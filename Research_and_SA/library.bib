It is an effective competitive inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii. lin-Benzoadenosylcobalamin is nonfluorescent in solution but, on homolytic (light) or heterolytic (acid, cyanide) cleavage of the carbon-cobalt bond, forms fluorescent products. In addition, fluorescence is detectable on binding of the coenzyme analogue to ribonucleotide reductase, and the observed fluorescence polarization of the lin-benzoadenosyl moiety indicates that it is bound loosely to the enzyme when the coenzyme is partially dissociated.},

  abstract = {ConspectusLight-responsive agents offer the promise of targeted therapy, whose benefits include (i) prolonged action at the target site, (ii) overall reduced systemic dosage, (iii) reduced adverse effects, and (iv) localized delivery of multiple agents. Although photoactivated prodrugs have been reported, these species generally require short wavelengths ($<$450 nm) for activation. However, maximal tissue penetrance by light occurs within the ``optical window of tissue'' (600\textendash{}900 nm), well beyond the wavelength range of most existing photocleavable functional groups. Furthermore, since multidrug therapy holds promise for the treatment of complex diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, controlling the action of multiple drugs via wavelength modulation would take advantage of a property that is unique to light. However, discrimination between existing photoresponsive moieties has thus far proven to be limited.We have developed a vitamin B12/light-facilitated strategy for controlling drug action using red, far-red, and NIR light. The technology is based on a light-triggered reaction displayed by a subset of B12 derivatives: alkyl-cob(III)alamins suffer photohomolysis of the C\textendash{}Co(III) bond. The C\textendash{}Co(III) bond is weak ($<$30 kcal/mol), and therefore all wavelengths absorbed by the corrin ring (330\textendash{}580 nm) induce photocleavage. In addition, by appending fluorophores to the corrin ring, long wavelength light ($>$600 nm) is readily captured and used to separate the Co-appended ligand (e.g., a drug) from B12. Consequently, it is now feasible to preassign the wavelength of homolysis by simply installing a fluorescent antenna with the desired photophysical properties. The wavelength malleability inherent within this strategy has been used to construct photoresponsive compounds that launch different drugs by simply modulating the wavelength of illumination. In addition, these phototherapeutics have been installed on the surface and interior of cells, such as erythrocytes or neural stem cells, and released upon expoure to the appropriate wavelength. We have shown that cytotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin, anti-inflammatories, such as dexamethasone, and anti- and pro-vascular agents are readily released from cellular vehicles as biologically active agents. We have also demonstrated that the concept of ``optical window of tissue'' phototherapeutics is not just limited to prodrugs. For example, stem cells have received considerable attention in the area of regenerative medicine. Hydrogels serve as scaffolds for stem cell growth and differentiation. We have shown that the formation of hydrogels can be triggered, in the presence of cells, using appropriately designed alkyl-cob(III)alamins and long wavelength light. The potential applications of phototherapeutics are broad and include drug delivery for a variety of indications, tissue engineering, and surgery.},

Here, RNA-based regulatory devices represent a promising emerging alternative to proteins, allowing a fast and direct control of gene expression, as no synthesis of regulatory proteins is required. Besides programmable ribozyme elements controlling mRNA stability, regulatory RNA structures in untranslated regions are highly interesting for engineering approaches. Riboswitches are especially well suited, as they show a modular composition of sensor and response elements, allowing a free combination of different modules in a plug-and-play-like mode. The sensor or aptamer domain specifically interacts with a trigger molecule as a ligand, modulating the activity of the adjacent response domain that controls the expression of the genes located downstream, in most cases at the level of transcription or translation. In this review, we discuss the recent advances and strategies for designing such synthetic riboswitches based on natural or artificial components and readout systems, from trial-and-error approaches to rational design strategies. As the past several years have shown dramatic development in this fascinating field of research, we can give only a limited overview of the basic riboswitch design principles that is far from complete, and we apologize for not being able to consider every successful and interesting approach described in the literature.},

Analysis of their absorption spectra, relative fluorescence quantum yields, and fluorescence lifetimes shows that static quenching occurs in both of these dual-labeled probes and that it is the dominant quenching mechanism in the Cy3.5-BHQ1 probe. Absorption spectra are consistent with the formation of an excitonic dimer, an intramolecular heterodimer between the Cy3.5 fluorophore and the BHQ1 quencher.},

  abstract = {Background: In vitro selection has been shown previously to be a powerful method for isolating nucleic acids with specific ligand-binding functions (`aptamers'). Given this capacity, we have sought to isolate RNA motifs that can confer fluorescent labeling to tagged RNA transcripts, potentially allowing in vivo detection and in vitro spectroscopic analysis of RNAs. Results: Two aptamers that recognize the fluorophore sulforhodamine B were isolated by the in vitro selection process. An unusually large motif of approximately 60 nucleotides is responsible for binding in one RNA (SRB-2). This motif consists of a three-way helical junction with two large, highly conserved unpaired regions. Phosphorothioate mapping with an iodoacetamide-tagged form of the ligand shows that these two regions make close contacts with the fluorophore, suggesting that the two loops combine to form separate halves of a binding pocket. The aptamer binds the fluorophore with high affinity, recognizing both the planar aromatic ring system and a negatively charged sulfonate, a rare example of anion recognition by RNA. An aptamer (FB-1) that specifically binds fluorescein has also been isolated by mutagenesis of a sulforhodamine aptamer followed by re-selection. In a simple in vitro test, SRB-2 and FB-1 have been shown to discriminate between sulforhodamine and fluorescein, specifically localizing each fluorophore to beads tagged with the corresponding aptamer. Conclusions:In addition to serving as a model system for understanding the basis of RNA folding and function, these experiments demonstrate potential applications for the aptamers in transcript double labeling or fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies.},

These RNAs include the Spinach and Spinach2 aptamers, which bind and activate the fluorescence of fluorophores similar to that found in green fluorescent protein. Although additional highly fluorescent RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes would extend the utility of this technology, the identification of novel RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes is difficult. Current approaches select aptamers on the basis of their ability to bind fluorophores, even though fluorophore binding alone is not sufficient to activate fluorescence. Additionally, aptamers require extensive mutagenesis to efficiently fold and exhibit fluorescence in living cells. Here we describe a platform for rapid generation of highly fluorescent RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes that are optimized for function in cells. This procedure involves selection of aptamers on the basis of their binding to fluorophores, coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of millions of aptamers expressed in Escherichia coli. Promising aptamers are then further optimized using a FACS-based directed evolution approach. Using this approach, we identified several novel aptamers, including a 49-nt aptamer, Broccoli. Broccoli binds and activates the fluorescence of (Z)-4-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-one. Broccoli shows robust folding and green fluorescence in cells, and increased fluorescence relative to Spinach2. This reflects, in part, improved folding in the presence of low cytosolic magnesium concentrations. Thus, this novel fluorescence-based selection approach simplifies the generation of aptamers that are optimized for expression and performance in living cells.},

Bioluminescence imaging is a tremendous asset to medical research, providing a way to monitor living cells noninvasively within their natural environments. Advances in imaging methods allow researchers to measure tumor growth, visualize developmental processes, and track cell-cell interactions. Yet technical limitations exist, and it is difficult to image deep tissues or detect low cell numbers in vivo. Iwano et al. designed a bioluminescence imaging system that produces brighter emission by up to a factor of 1000 compared with conventional technology (see the Perspective by Nasu and Campbell). Individual tumor cells were successfully visualized in the lungs of mice. Small numbers of striatal neurons were detected in the brains of naturally behaving marmosets. The ability of the substrate to cross the blood-brain barrier should provide important opportunities for neuroscience research.
Science, this issue p. 935; see also p. 868
Bioluminescence is a natural light source based on luciferase catalysis of its substrate luciferin. We performed directed evolution on firefly luciferase using a red-shifted and highly deliverable luciferin analog to establish AkaBLI, an all-engineered bioluminescence in vivo imaging system. AkaBLI produced emissions in vivo that were brighter by a factor of 100 to 1000 than conventional systems, allowing noninvasive visualization of single cells deep inside freely moving animals. Single tumorigenic cells trapped in the mouse lung vasculature could be visualized. In the mouse brain, genetic labeling with neural activity sensors allowed tracking of small clusters of hippocampal neurons activated by novel environments. In a marmoset, we recorded video-rate bioluminescence from neurons in the striatum, a deep brain area, for more than 1 year. AkaBLI is therefore a bioengineered light source to spur unprecedented scientific, medical, and industrial applications.
A bioengineered light source allows in vivo imaging of individual cells.

  abstract = {The N-end rule pathway is a proteolytic system in which N-terminal residues of short-lived proteins are recognized by recognition components (N-recognins) as essential components of degrons, called N-degrons. Known N-recognins in eukaryotes mediate protein ubiquitylation and selective proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. Substrates of N-recognins can be generated when normally embedded destabilizing residues are exposed at the N terminus by proteolytic cleavage. N-degrons can also be generated through modifications of posttranslationally exposed pro-N-degrons of otherwise stable proteins; such modifications include oxidation, arginylation, leucylation, phenylalanylation, and acetylation. Although there are variations in components, degrons, and hierarchical structures, the proteolytic systems based on generation and recognition of N-degrons have been observed in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes examined thus far. The N-end rule pathway regulates homeostasis of various physiological processes, in part, through interaction with small molecules.

  abstract = {Our previous work has shown that, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, any of the eight stabilizing amino-terminal residues confers a long (greater than 20 h) half-life on a test protein beta-galactosidase (beta gal), whereas 12 destabilizing amino-terminal residues confer on beta gal half-lives from less than 3 min to 30 min. We now show that an analogous single-residue code (the N-end rule) operates in an in vitro system derived from mammalian reticulocytes. We also show that the N-end rule has a hierarchical structure. Specifically, amino-terminal Glu and Asp (and also Cys in reticulocytes) are secondary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be conjugated to primary destabilizing residues such as Arg. Amino-terminal Gln and Asn are tertiary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be converted, via selective deamidation, into secondary destabilizing residues Glu and Asp. Furthermore, in reticulocytes, distinct types of the N-end-recognizing activity are shown to be specific for three classes of primary destabilizing residues: basic (Arg, Lys, His), bulky hydrophobic (Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr), and small uncharged (Ala, Ser, Thr). Features of the N-end rule in reticulocytes suggest that the exact form of the N-end rule may depend on the cell's physiological state, thereby providing a mechanism for selective destruction of preexisting proteins upon cell differentiation.},

FLARE senses the coincidence of elevated cytosolic calcium and externally applied blue light, which together produce translocation of a membrane-anchored transcription factor to the nucleus to drive expression of any transgene. In cultured rat neurons, FLARE gives a light-to-dark signal ratio of 120 and a high- to low-calcium signal ratio of 10 after 10 min of stimulation. Opsin expression permitted functional manipulation of FLARE-marked neurons. In adult mice, FLARE also gave light- and motor-activity-dependent transcription in the cortex.

  abstract = {Summary
To execute accurate movements, animals must continuously adapt their behavior to changes in their~bodies and environments. Animals can learn changes in the relationship between their locomotor commands and the resulting distance moved, then adjust command strength to achieve a desired travel distance. It is largely unknown which circuits implement this form of motor learning, or how. Using whole-brain neuronal imaging and circuit manipulations in larval zebrafish, we discovered that the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) mediates short-term locomotor learning. Serotonergic DRN neurons respond phasically to swim-induced visual motion, but little to motion that is not self-generated. During prolonged exposure to a given motosensory gain, persistent DRN activity emerges that stores the learned efficacy of motor commands and adapts future locomotor drive for tens of seconds. The DRN's ability to track the effectiveness of motor intent may constitute a computational building block~for the broader functions of the serotonergic system.

In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5\textendash{}40-$\mathrm{\mu}$m long).

  abstract = {The when, where, and how of translation
High-resolution single-molecule imaging shows the spatial and temporal dynamics of molecular events (see the Perspective by Iwasaki and Ingolia). Wu et al. and Morisaki et al. developed an approach to study the translation of single messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in live cells. Nascent polypeptides containing multimerized epitopes were imaged with fluorescent antibody fragments, while simultaneously detecting the single mRNAs using a different fluorescent tag. The approach enabled a direct readout of initiation and elongation, as well as revealing the spatial distribution of translation and allowing the correlation of polysome motility with translation dynamics. Membrane-targeted mRNAs could be distinguished from cytoplasmic mRNAs, as could single polysomes from higher-order polysomal complexes. Furthermore, the work reveals the stochasticity of translation, which can occur constitutively or in bursts, much like transcription, and the spatial regulation of translation in neuronal dendrites.
Science, this issue p. 1430, p. 1425; see also p. 1391
Although messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a fundamental biological process, it has never been imaged in real time in vivo with single-molecule precision. To achieve this, we developed nascent chain tracking (NCT), a technique that uses multi-epitope tags and antibody-based fluorescent probes to quantify protein synthesis dynamics at the single-mRNA level. NCT reveals an elongation rate of \textasciitilde{}10 amino acids per second, with initiation occurring stochastically every \textasciitilde{}30 seconds. Polysomes contain \textasciitilde{}1 ribosome every 200 to 900 nucleotides and are globular rather than elongated in shape. By developing multicolor probes, we showed that most polysomes act independently; however, a small fraction (\textasciitilde{}5\%) form complexes in which two distinct mRNAs can be translated simultaneously. The sensitivity and versatility of NCT make it a powerful new tool for quantifying mRNA translation kinetics.
Tracking nascent protein chains in living cells with antibody-based probes reveals the stochastic nature of single mRNA translation.

The prepared conjugate, CBC, bound to the transporting proteins, intrinsic factor (IF) and transcobalamin (TC), responsible for the uptake of Cbl in an organism. Pronounced increase in fluorescence upon CBC attachment facilitated detailed kinetic analysis of Cbl binding. We found that TC had the same affinity for CBC and Cbl (Kd?=?5???10?15?m), whereas interaction of CBC with the highly specific protein IF was more complex. For instance, CBC behaved normally in the partial reactions CBC?+?IF30 and CBC?+?IF20 when binding to the isolated IF fragments (domains). The ligand could also assemble them into a stable complex IF30?CBC?IF20 with higher fluorescent signal. However, dissociation of IF30?CBC?IF20 and IF?CBC was accelerated by factors of 3 and 20, respectively, when compared to the corresponding Cbl complexes. We suggest that the correct domain?domain interactions are the most important factor during recognition and fixation of the ligands by IF. Dissociation of IF?CBC was biphasic, and existence of multiple protein?analogue complexes with normal and partially corrupted structure may explain this behaviour. The most stable component had Kd?=?1.5???10?13?m, which guarantees the binding of CBC to IF under physiological conditions. The specific intestinal receptor cubilin bound both IF?CBC and IF?Cbl with equal affinity. In conclusion, the fluorescent analogue CBC can be used as a reporting agent in the kinetic studies, moreover, it seems to be applicable for imaging purposes in vivo.},

In each case, recognition is accomplished through shape complementarity between the RNA and cobalamin, with relatively few hydrogen bonding interactions that typically govern RNA\textendash{}small molecule recognition. We show that a composite cobalamin\textendash{}RNA scaffold stabilizes an unusual long-range intramolecular kissing-loop interaction that controls mRNA expression.

These techniques are beginning to profoundly alter our abilities to look at biological structures and dynamics and are bound to spread into conventional biological laboratories. Nowadays these approaches can be divided into two categories, one based on targeted switching and readout, and the other based on stochastic switching and readout of the fluorescence information. The main prerequisite for a successful implementation of both categories is the ability to prepare the fluorescent emitters in two distinct states, a bright and a dark state. Herein, we provide an overview of recent developments in super?resolution microscopy techniques and outline the special requirements for the fluorescent probes used. In combination with the advances in understanding the photophysics and photochemistry of single fluorophores, we demonstrate how essentially any single?molecule compatible fluorophore can be used for super?resolution microscopy. We present examples for super?resolution microscopy with standard organic fluorophores, discuss factors that influence resolution and present approaches for calibration samples for super?resolution microscopes including AFM?based single?molecule assembly and DNA origami.},

The ability to transduce a near?field interaction into a far?field signal has provided a unique optical tool to assess biological phenomena well below the resolution of standard optical microscopy. In recent years, sub?diffraction microscopy techniques have achieved maturation and are increasingly used in biological applications. As the resolution of these methods increases they will slowly encroach on the domains where FRET is now dominant. Herein we review the major applications in biological FRET imaging and we discuss the possibilities and challenges in the super?resolution era.},

  abstract = {In order to gain deeper insight into the functions and dynamics of RNA in cells, the development of methods for imaging multiple RNAs simultaneously is of paramount importance. Here, we describe a modular approach to image RNA in living cells using an RNA aptamer that binds to dinitroaniline, an efficient general contact quencher. Dinitroaniline quenches the fluorescence of different fluorophores when directly conjugated to them via ethylene glycol linkers by forming a non-fluorescent intramolecular complex. Since the binding of the RNA aptamer to the quencher destroys the fluorophore-quencher complex, fluorescence increases dramatically upon binding. Using this principle, a series of fluorophores were turned into fluorescent turn-on probes by conjugating them to dinitroaniline. These probes ranged from fluorescein-dinitroaniline (green) to TexasRed-dinitroaniline (red) spanning across the visible spectrum. The dinitroaniline-binding aptamer (DNB) was generated by in vitro selection, and was found to bind all probes, leading to fluorescence increase in vitro and in living cells. When expressed in E. coli, the DNB aptamer could be labelled and visualized with different-coloured fluorophores and therefore it can be used as a genetically encoded tag to image target RNAs. Furthermore, combining contact-quenched fluorogenic probes with orthogonal DNB (the quencher-binding RNA aptamer) and SRB-2 aptamers (a fluorophore-binding RNA aptamer) allowed dual-colour imaging of two different fluorescence-enhancing RNA tags in living cells, opening new avenues for studying RNA co-localization and trafficking.},

  abstract = {Genetically encoded fluorescent ribonucleic acids (RNAs) have diverse applications, including imaging RNA trafficking and as a component of RNA-based sensors that exhibit fluorescence upon binding small molecules in live cells. These RNAs include the Spinach and Spinach2 aptamers, which bind and activate the fluorescence of fluorophores similar to that found in green fluorescent protein. Although additional highly fluorescent RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes would extend the utility of this technology, the identification of novel RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes is difficult. Current approaches select aptamers on the basis of their ability to bind fluorophores, even though fluorophore binding alone is not sufficient to activate fluorescence. Additionally, aptamers require extensive mutagenesis to efficiently fold and exhibit fluorescence in living cells. Here we describe a platform for rapid generation of highly fluorescent RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes that are optimized for function in cells. This procedure involves selection of aptamers on the basis of their binding to fluorophores, coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of millions of aptamers expressed in Escherichia coli. Promising aptamers are then further optimized using a FACS-based directed evolution approach. Using this approach, we identified several novel aptamers, including a 49-nt aptamer, Broccoli. Broccoli binds and activates the fluorescence of (Z)-4-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-one. Broccoli shows robust folding and green fluorescence in cells, and increased fluorescence relative to Spinach2. This reflects, in part, improved folding in the presence of low cytosolic magnesium concentrations. Thus, this novel fluorescence-based selection approach simplifies the generation of aptamers that are optimized for expression and performance in living cells.},

Visualization of RNA Mango by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, together with injection and imaging of RNA Mango/fluorophore complex in C. elegans gonads demonstrates the potential for live-cell RNA imaging with this system. By inserting RNA Mango into a stem loop of the bacterial 6S RNA and biotinylating the fluorophore, we demonstrate that the aptamer can be used to simultaneously fluorescently label and purify biologically important RNAs.

Although some mRNAs are compartmentalized in cytoplasmic regions, most mRNAs, such as housekeeping mRNAs or the poly-adenylated mRNA population, are believed to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm [1\textendash{}4]. The general mechanism by which all mRNAs may move, and how this may be related to localization, is unknown. Here, we report a method to visualize single mRNA molecules in living mammalian cells, and we report that, regardless of any specific cytoplasmic distribution, individual mRNA molecules exhibit rapid and directional movements on microtubules. Importantly, the $\beta$-actin mRNA zipcode increased both the frequency and length of these movements, providing a common mechanistic basis for both localized and nonlocalized mRNAs. Disruption of the cytoskeleton with drugs showed that microtubules and microfilaments are involved in the types of mRNA movements we have observed, which included complete immobility and corralled and nonrestricted diffusion. Individual mRNA molecules switched frequently among these movements, suggesting that mRNAs undergo continuous cycles of anchoring, diffusion, and active transport.},

Rhodol VoltageFluor-5 (RVF5) is a voltage-sensitive dye with improved 2P cross-section for use in thick tissue or brain samples. RVF5 features a dichlororhodol core with pyrrolidyl substitution at the nitrogen center. In mammalian cells under one-photon (1P) illumination, RVF5 demonstrates high voltage sensitivity (28\% $\Delta$F/F per 100 mV) and improved photostability relative to first-generation voltage sensors. This photostability enables multisite optical recordings from neurons lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 1, Tsc1, in a mouse model of genetic epilepsy. Using RVF5, we show that Tsc1 KO neurons exhibit increased activity relative to wild-type neurons and additionally show that the proportion of active neurons in the network increases with the loss of Tsc1. The high photostability and voltage sensitivity of RVF5 is recapitulated under 2P illumination. Finally, the ability to chemically tune the 2P absorption profile through the use of rhodol scaffolds affords the unique opportunity to image neuronal voltage changes in acutely prepared mouse brain slices using 2P illumination. Stimulation of the mouse hippocampus evoked spiking activity that was readily discerned with bath-applied RVF5, demonstrating the utility of RVF5 and molecular wire-based voltage sensors with 2P-optimized fluorophores for imaging voltage in intact brain tissue.},

However, the folding free energies of the trpzips exceed substantially those of all previously reported $\beta$-hairpins and even those of some larger designed proteins. NMR structures of three of the trpzip peptides reveal exceptionally well-defined $\beta$-hairpin conformations stabilized by cross-strand pairs of indole rings. The trpzips are the smallest peptides to adopt an unique tertiary fold without requiring metal binding, unusual amino acids, or disulfide crosslinks.},

Optimization was achieved by designing a hydrophobic cluster that sequesters these H-bonds from solvent exposure.

These two systems are greater than 94\% folded at 298 K (97.5\% at 280 K) with melting temperatures $>$75 $^\circ$C. The fold appears to display minimal fluxionality; a well-converged NMR structure rationalizes all of the large structuring shifts observed, and we suggest that these designed constructs can be viewed as microproteins.},

  abstract = {The p53 gene is mutated in over half of all cancers, reflecting its critical role as a tumor suppressor. Although p53 is a transcriptional activator that induces myriad target genes, those p53-inducible genes most critical for tumor suppression remain elusive. Here, we leveraged p53 ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) data sets to identify new p53 target genes, focusing on the noncoding genome. We identify Neat1, a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) constituent of paraspeckles, as a p53 target gene broadly induced by mouse and human p53 in different cell types and by diverse stress signals. Using fibroblasts derived from Neat1-/- mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53 pathway. We found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in suppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency enhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the development of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and cystic lesions in KrasG12D-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes in gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes neoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and cancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor suppression.},

Chlororhodibalamin, when reacted with silver nitrate, is converted into aquorhodibalamin. In the absence of oxygen, chloro- and aquorhodibalamin are readily reduced by sodium borohydride to rhodibalamin s, the corresponding rhodium(I) complex. Addition of methyl iodide or 5'-iodo-5'-deoxyadenosine to rhodibalamin s yields as the major products methylrhodibalamin and 5'-deoxyadenosylrhodibalamin, respectively. The structure of methylrhodibalamin was demonstrated by the synthesis of [14C]methylrhodibalamin, containing the expected radioactive label in stoichiometric proportion. Methylrhodibalamin exhibits a signal for 3 protons in the NMR spectrum at -1.64 ppm, proving the attachment of the methyl group to rhodium. The structure of 5'-deoxyadenosylrhodibalamin is confirmed by its conversion into dicyanorhodibalamin, adenine, and the cyanhydrin of d-erythro-2,3-dihydroxypent-4-enal in the presence of cyanide.

  abstract = {Cobalamins are of widespread importance in biology. Both of the cofactors essential for human metabolism, the organocobalamins coenzyme B12 and methylcobalamin, are highly photolabile, as are other alkylcobalamins. The alkynylcobalamin phenylethynylcobalamin (PhEtyCbl) and the arylcobalamin 4-ethylphenylcobalamin (EtPhCbl) with ``atypical'' Co\textendash{}C-bonds to unsaturated carbons, were recently designed as metabolically inert cobalamins, classified as ``antivitamins B12''. The further development of an ideal light-activated or ``conditional'' antivitamin B12 would require it to be readily converted by light into an active B12 vitamin form. Very photolabile ``antivitamins B12'' would also represent particularly useful scaffolds for therapeutic light-activated reagents. Here, the photoactive arylcobalamin EtPhCbl and the remarkably photostable alkynylcobalamin PhEtyCbl are examined using femtosecond to picosecond UV\textendash{}visible transient absorption spectroscopy. PhEtyCbl undergoes internal conversion to the ground state with near unit quantum yield on a time scale $<$ 100 ps and an activation energy of 12.6 $\pm$ 1.4 kJ/mol. The arylcobalamin EtPhCbl forms an excited state with a ca. 247 ps lifetime. This excited state branches between internal conversion to the ground state and formation of a long-lived base-off species with a quantum yield of $\sim$9\%. Anaerobic steady state photolysis of ``light-sensitive'' EtPhCbl results in the formation of cob(II)alamin, but only with quantum yield $<$1\%. Hence, our studies suggest that suitably modified arylcobalamins may be a rational basis for the design of photoresponsive ``antivitamins B12''.},

Using molecular beacons to track single mRNA molecules in living cells, we have characterized the diffusion of mRNP complexes in the nucleus. The mRNP complexes move freely by Brownian diffusion at a rate that assures their dispersion throughout the nucleus before they exit into the cytoplasm, even when the transcription site is located near the nuclear periphery. The diffusion of mRNP complexes is restricted to the extranucleolar, interchromatin spaces. When mRNP complexes wander into dense chromatin, they tend to become stalled. Although the movement of mRNP complexes occurs without the expenditure of metabolic energy, ATP is required for the complexes to resume their motion after they become stalled. This finding provides an explanation for a number of observations in which mRNA transport appeared to be an enzymatically facilitated process.},

The discovery of extensive transcription of large RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins, termed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), provides an important new perspective on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Here, we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

The cobalamin-biotin conjugates were prepared to evaluate the effect that the location of attachment had on the binding with transcobalamin II (TCII), the cobalamin binding protein in plasma, and to evaluate their potential use for in vitro and in vivo applications. This study focused only on the effect of binding with TCII. To decrease the possibility of steric problems in binding of the cobalamin conjugates with TCII, and biotin's binding with streptavidin or avidin, moieties of 11-18 atoms in length were used as linkers. Four biotin conjugates were prepared which were attached to the corrin ring of the cobalamin molecule (on b-, c-, d-, and e-side chains). One conjugate was attached to the 5`-OH of the ribose moiety, and another conjugate was attached at the cobalt metal (in place of the cyanide moiety of cyanocobalamin). Competitive binding studies were conducted where various amounts of the cobalamin-biotin conjugates and their precursor cobalamin derivatives competed with [57Co]cyanocobalamin for binding of recombinant human TCII (rhTCII). Evaluation of cobalamin derivatives which were conjugated at the 5`-OH of ribose or the cobalt metal center indicated that conjugation at either of these positions had little effect on binding with rhTCII. However, conjugates where the attachment was made on the corrin ring substituents had a large variation in binding with rhTCII. Conjugates on the e-propionamide side chain had little effect (relative affinity was equal to or decreased less than a factor of 3) on binding with rhTCII, conjugates of the b-isomer had decreased binding (relative affinity decreased less than a factor of 10), conjugates of the d-propionamide had further decreased binding (relative affinity decreased between 44 and 69 times), and conjugates on the c-acetamide group had poor binding to rhTCII (relative affinity decreased between 295 and 1160 times). The significance of the side chains on the corrin ring in providing specificity and high-affinity binding with rhTCII is discussed.},

Aptamer ZT-26 exhibits significantly enhanced fluorescence over Spinach only in vitro. However, aptamer ZT-324 is 36 \% brighter than Spinach when expressed in E. coli.

Riboswitches are naturally occurring sensors of intracellular metabolites, primarily found in the bacterial mRNA leaders and regulating their expression. These regulatory elements are generally composed of two domains: an aptamer that binds a specific effector molecule and an expression platform that informs the transcriptional or translational machinery. While it was long established that riboswitch aptamers are modular and portable, capable of directing different output domains including ribozymes, switches, and fluorophore-binding modules, the same has not been demonstrated until recently for expression platforms. We have engineered and validated a set of expression platforms that regulate transcription through a secondary structural switch that can host a variety of different aptamers, including those derived through in vitro selection methods, to create novel chimeric riboswitches. These synthetic switches are capable of a highly specific regulatory response both in vitro and in vivo. Here we present the methodology for the design and engineering of chimeric switches using biological expression platforms.},

For generation of artificial ligands, they are isolated from combinatorial libraries of synthetic nucleic acid by exponential enrichment, via an in vitro iterative process of adsorption, recovery and reamplification known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Thanks to their unique characteristics and chemical structure, aptamers offer themselves as ideal candidates for use in analytical devices and techniques. Recent progress in the aptamer selection and incorporation of aptamers into molecular beacon structures will ensure the application of aptamers for functional and quantitative proteomics and high-throughput screening for drug discovery, as well as in various analytical applications. The properties of aptamers as well as recent developments in improved, time-efficient methods for their selection and stabilization are outlined. The use of these powerful molecular tools for analysis and the advantages they offer over existing affinity biocomponents are discussed. Finally the evolving use of aptamers in specific analytical applications such as chromatography, ELISA-type assays, biosensors and affinity PCR as well as current avenues of research and future perspectives conclude this review.},

In addition to identifying many known and predicted genes, we found 10,595 transcribed sequences not detected by other methods. A large fraction of these are located in intergenic regions distal from previously annotated genes and exhibit significant homology to other mammalian proteins.

The coding potential of these novel expressed regions is supported by their sequence conservation in the mouse genome.

It remains largely unknown, however, how these modifications dynamically change in individual cells. By using fluorescently labeled specific antigen binding fragments (Fabs), we have developed a general method to monitor the distribution and global level of endogenous histone H3 lysine modifications in living cells without disturbing cell growth and embryo development. Fabs produce distinct nuclear patterns that are characteristic of their target modifications. H3K27 trimethylation-specific Fabs, for example, are concentrated on inactive X chromosomes. As Fabs bind their targets transiently, the ratio of bound and free molecules depends on the target concentration, allowing us to measure changes in global modification levels. High-affinity Fabs are suitable for mouse embryo imaging, so we have used them to monitor H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation levels in mouse preimplantation embryos produced by in vitro fertilization and somatic cell nuclear transfer. The data suggest that a high level of H3K27 acetylation is important for normal embryo development. As Fab-based live endogenous modification labeling (FabLEM) is broadly useful for visualizing any modification, it should be a powerful tool for studying cell signaling and diagnosis in the future.},

We describe and characterize an exceptionally rapid and simple new technique for loading large numbers of cultured cells with large macromolecules.

Glass beads (75\textendash{}500 micron diameter) are then sprinkled onto the cells, the cells are washed free of beads and exogenous macromolecules, and `bead-loading' is completed. The conditions for bead-loading can readily be modified to accommodate cell type and loading objectives: for example, the amount of loading per cell increases if bead size is increased or if beads are agitated after sprinkling onto the monolayer, but at the expense of increased cell loss. As many as 97\% of a population of bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were loaded with a 10,000 Mr dextran; and 79\% with a 150,000 Mr dextran using bead-loading. Various cell lines have been loaded using glass beads. Moreover, bead-loading has the advantage of producing loaded cells that remain adherent and well-spread, thus minimizing recovery time and permitting immediate microscopic examination.},

Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C?C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C?X?C), an approach we call ?click chemistry?. Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect ?spring?loaded? reactions.

This addition of two carbon atoms doubles the quantum efficiency and improves the photon yield of the dye in applications ranging from in vitro single-molecule measurements to super-resolution imaging. The novel substitution is generalizable, yielding a palette of chemical dyes with improved quantum efficiencies that spans the UV and visible range.},

Although the aptamer\textendash{}fluorogen system is sufficient for imaging highly abundant non-coding RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, etc.), it performs poorly for mRNA imaging due to low brightness. In addition, whether the aptamer-fluorogen system may perturb the native RNA characteristics has not been systematically characterized at the levels of RNA transcription, translation and degradation. To increase the brightness of these aptamer-fluorogen systems, we constructed and tested tandem arrays containing multiple Spinach aptamers (8\textendash{}64 aptamer repeats). Such arrays enhanced the brightness of the tagged mRNA molecules by up to \textasciitilde{}17 fold in living cells. Strong laser excitation with pulsed illumination further increased the imaging sensitivity of Spinach array-tagged RNAs. Moreover, transcriptional fusion to the Spinach array did not affect mRNA transcription, translation or degradation, indicating that aptamer arrays might be a generalizable labeling method for high-performance and low-perturbation live cell RNA imaging.},

The ribosome translates the information contained within messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins. When and where ribosomes encounter mRNAs can regulate gene expression. Halstead et al. developed an RNA biosensor that allows single molecules of mRNAs that have never been translated to be distinguished from ones that have undergone translation by the ribosome in living cells (see the Perspective by Popp and Maquat). The authors demonstrated the utility of their technique by examining the spatial and temporal regulation of translation in single cells and in Drosophila oocytes during development.
Science, this issue p. 1367; see also p. 1316
Analysis of single molecules in living cells has provided quantitative insights into the kinetics of fundamental biological processes; however, the dynamics of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation have yet to be addressed. We have developed a fluorescence microscopy technique that reports on the first translation events of individual mRNA molecules. This allowed us to examine the spatiotemporal regulation of translation during normal growth and stress and during Drosophila oocyte development. We have shown that mRNAs are not translated in the nucleus but translate within minutes after export, that sequestration within P-bodies regulates translation, and that oskar mRNA is not translated until it reaches the posterior pole of the oocyte. This methodology provides a framework for studying initiation of protein synthesis on single mRNAs in living cells.
