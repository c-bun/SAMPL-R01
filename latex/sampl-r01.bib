  abstract = {Here, an efficient method that predicts natural transition pathways between two endpoint states of an allosteric protein has been proposed. This method helps create structures that bridge these endpoints through multiple iterative and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water. Difference distance matrices provide an approach for identifying states involving concerted slow motion. A series of structures are readily generated along the transition pathways of adenylate kinase. Predicted structures may be useful for an initial pathway to evaluate free energy landscapes via umbrella sampling and chain-of-states methods. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

ZIKV relies on its NS2B/NS3 protease for polyprotein processing; hence, this enzyme is an attractive drug target. The 2.7 {\AA} crystal structure of ZIKV protease in complex with a peptidomimetic boronic-acid inhibitor reveals a cyclic diester between the boronic acid and glycerol. The P2 4-aminomethylphenylalanine moiety of the inhibitor forms a salt-bridge with the non-conserved Asp83 of NS2B, Ion-pairing between Asp83 and the P2 residue of the substrate likely accounts for the enzyme's high catalytic efficiency. The unusual dimer of the ZIKV protease:inhibitor complex seen in the crystal may provide a model for assemblies formed at high local concentrations of protease at the endoplasmatic reticulum membrane, the site of polyprotein processing.},

  abstract = {Classical 3-point rigid water models are most widely used due to their computational efficiency. Recently, we introduced a new approach to constructing classical rigid water models [S. Izadi et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 5, 3863 (2014)], which permits a virtually exhaustive search for globally optimal model parameters in the sub-space that is most relevant to the electrostatic properties of the water molecule in liquid phase. Here we apply the approach to develop a 3-point Optimal Point Charge (OPC3) water model. OPC3 is significantly more accurate than the commonly used water models of same class (TIP3P and SPCE) in reproducing a comprehensive set of liquid bulk properties, over a wide range of temperatures. Beyond bulk properties, we show that OPC3 predicts the intrinsic charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) of water \textemdash{} a characteristic dependence of hydration free energy on the sign of the solute charge \textemdash{} in very close agreement with experiment. Two other recent 3-point rigid water models, TIP3PFB and H2ODC, each developed by its own, completely different optimization method, approach the global accuracy optimum represented by OPC3 in both the parameter space and accuracy of bulk properties. Thus, we argue that an accuracy limit of practical 3-point rigid non-polarizable models has effectively been reached; remaining accuracy issues are discussed.},

To this end, we have performed initially blind free energy calculations to determine the free energies of binding for ligands of both the CB7 and OA hosts. A subset of the selected guest molecules were those included in the SAMPL4 prediction challenge. Using expanded ensemble simulations in the dimension of coupling host\textendash{}guest intermolecular interactions, we are able to show that our estimates in most cases can be demonstrated to fully converge and that the errors in our estimates are due almost entirely to the assigned force field parameters and the choice of environmental conditions used to model experiment. We confirm the convergence through the use of alternative simulation methodologies and thermodynamic pathways, analyzing sampled conformations, and directly observing changes of the free energy with respect to simulation time. Our results demonstrate the benefits of enhanced sampling of multiple local free energy minima made possible by the use of expanded ensemble molecular dynamics and may indicate the presence of significant problems with current transferable force fields for organic molecules when used for calculating binding affinities, especially in non-protein chemistries.},

  abstract = {Force field accuracy is still one of the ``stalemates'' in biomolecular modeling. Model systems with high quality experimental data are valuable instruments for the validation and improvement of effective potentials. With respect to protein\textendash{}ligand binding, organic host\textendash{}guest complexes have long served as models for both experimental and computational studies because of the abundance of binding affinity data available for such systems. Binding affinity data collected for cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexes, a popular model for molecular recognition, is potentially a more reliable resource for tuning energy parameters than hydration free energy measurements. Convergence of binding free energy calculations on CD host\textendash{}guest systems can also be obtained rapidly, thus offering the opportunity to assess the robustness of these parameters. In this work, we demonstrate how implicit solvent parameters can be developed using binding affinity experimental data and the binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) and validated using the Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory analysis. These new solvation parameters were used to study protein\textendash{}ligand binding in two drug targets against the HIV-1 virus and improved the agreement between the calculated and the experimental binding affinities. This work illustrates how benchmark sets of high quality experimental binding affinity data and physics-based binding free energy models can be used to evaluate and optimize force fields for protein\textendash{}ligand systems.

  abstract = {Accurate methods for predicting protein\textendash{}ligand binding affinities are of central interest to computer-aided drug design for hit identification and lead optimization. Here, we used the mining minima (M2) method to predict cucurbit[7]uril binding affinities from the SAMPL4 blind prediction challenge. We tested two different energy models, an empirical classical force field, CHARMm with VCharge charges, and the Poisson\textendash{}Boltzmann surface area solvation model; and a semiempirical quantum mechanical (QM) Hamiltonian, PM6-DH+, coupled with the COSMO solvation model and a surface area term for nonpolar solvation free energy. Binding affinities based on the classical force field correlated strongly with the experiments with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.74. On the other hand, binding affinities based on the QM energy model correlated poorly with experiments (R2 = 0.24), due largely to two major outliers. As we used extensive conformational search methods, these results point to possible inaccuracies in the PM6-DH+ energy model or the COSMO solvation model. Furthermore, the different binding free energy components, solute energy, solvation free energy, and configurational entropy showed significant deviations between the classical M2 and quantum M2 calculations. Comparison of different classical M2 free energy components to experiments show that the change in the total energy, i.e. the solute energy plus the solvation free energy, is the key driving force for binding, with a reasonable correlation to experiment (R2 = 0.56); however, accounting for configurational entropy further improves the correlation.},

  abstract = {Electrostatic free energies play an essential role in numerous biomolecular processes occurring in solution. Difficulties arise when the long-range Coulomb interaction is computed for idealised infinite simulation models with periodic boundary conditions. To maintain a neutral simulation box and a finite per-box energy, a neutralising charge density or `gellium' is commonly used, leading to a mean box potential that is constrained to be rigorously equal to zero at all times. Thus, in considering quantities such as ion solvation free energy, the potential drop to move from solvent into the usual, gas phase reference state is missing. In fact, for an infinite molecular system, the electrostatic potential itself is not uniquely defined, but takes the form of an infinite series that is only conditionally convergent. This leads to several possible computational conventions that give different values for the potential and field, all mathematically valid. For experimentally measurable quantities, however, unique results are obtained when sufficiently large simulation boxes are utilised. These concepts are detailed, as well as a fundamental, linear response theoretical framework that provides qualitative understanding of the physical processes involved, especially dielectric relaxation of the environment in response to a new solute charge. Illustrative applications to ligand binding and biomolecular electron transfer are described.},

  abstract = {The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host\&apos;s nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions.},

  abstract = {We used the second-generation mining minima method (M2) to compute the binding affinities of the novel host\textendash{}guest complexes in the SAMPL3 blind prediction challenge. The predictions were in poor agreement with experiment, and we conjectured that much of the error might derive from the force field, CHARMm with Vcharge charges. Repeating the calculations with other generalized force-fields led to no significant improvement, and we observed that the predicted affinities were highly sensitive to the choice of force-field. We therefore embarked on a systematic evaluation of a set of generalized force fields, based upon comparisons with PM6-DH2, a fast yet accurate semi-empirical quantum mechanics method. In particular, we compared gas-phase interaction energies and entropies for the host\textendash{}guest complexes themselves, as well as for smaller chemical fragments derived from the same molecules. The mean deviations of the force field interaction energies from the quantum results were greater than 3 kcal/mol and 9 kcal/mol, for the fragments and host\textendash{}guest systems respectively. We further evaluated the accuracy of force-fields for computing the vibrational entropies and found the mean errors to be greater than 4 kcal/mol. Given these errors in energy and entropy, it is not surprising in retrospect that the predicted binding affinities deviated from the experiment by several kcal/mol. These results emphasize the need for improvements in generalized force-fields and also highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of force-field parameters prior to evaluating different free-energy methods.},

Adamantane based derivatives which snuggly fit within the pocket of octa-acid deep cavity cavitands exhibit some of the strongest host binding. Here we explore the roles of guest size and attractiveness on optimizing guest binding to form 1:1 complexes with octa-acid cavitands in water. Specifically we simulate the water-mediated interactions of the cavitand with adamantane and a range of simple Lennard-Jones guests of varying diameter and attractive well-depth. Initial simulations performed with methane indicate hydrated methanes preferentially reside within the host pocket, although these guests frequently trade places with water and other methanes in bulk solution. The interaction strength of hydrophobic guests increases with increasing size from sizes slightly smaller than methane to Lennard-Jones guests comparable in size to adamantane. Over this guest size range the preferential guest binding location migrates from the bottom of the host pocket upwards. For guests larger than adamantane, however, binding becomes less favorable as the minimum in the potential-of-mean force shifts to the cavitand face around the portal. For a fixed guest diameter, the Lennard-Jones well-depth is found to systematically shift the guest-host potential-of-mean force to lower free energies, however, the optimal guest size is found to be insensitive to increasing well-depth. Ultimately our simulations show that adamantane lies within the optimal range of guest sizes with significant attractive interactions to match the most tightly bound Lennard-Jones guests studied.},

Both charge sets give good and nearly identical results, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 4 kJ/mol and a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.8 compared to experimental results. Second, we tried to improve these predictions with 28,800 density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for selected snapshots and the non-Boltzmann Bennett acceptance-ratio method, but this led to much worse results, probably because of a too large difference between the MM and DFT potential-energy functions. Third, we tried to calculate absolute affinities using minimised DFT structures. This gave intermediate-quality results with MADs of 5\textendash{}9 kJ/mol and R2 = 0.6\textendash{}0.8, depending on how the structures were obtained. Finally, we tried to improve these results using local coupled-cluster calculations with single and double excitations, and non-iterative perturbative treatment of triple excitations (LCCSD(T0)), employing the polarisable multipole interactions with supermolecular pairs approach. Unfortunately, this only degraded the predictions, probably because of a mismatch between the solvation energies obtained at the DFT and LCCSD(T0) levels.},

  abstract = {We present a new protocol for deriving force constant parameters that are used in molecular mechanics (MM) force fields to describe the bond-stretching, angle-bending, and dihedral terms. A 3 \texttimes{} 3 partial matrix is chosen from the MM Hessian matrix in Cartesian coordinates according to a simple rule and made as close as possible to the corresponding partial Hessian matrix computed using quantum mechanics (QM). This partial Hessian fitting (PHF) is done analytically and thus rapidly in a least-squares sense, yielding force constant parameters as the output. We herein apply this approach to derive force constant parameters for the AMBER-type energy expression. Test calculations on several different molecules show good performance of the PHF parameter sets in terms of how well they can reproduce QM-calculated frequencies. When soft bonds are involved in the target molecule as in the case of secondary building units of metal-organic frameworks, the MM-optimized geometry sometimes deviates significantly from the QM-optimized one. We show that this problem is rectified effectively by use of a simple procedure called Katachi that modifies the equilibrium bond distances and angles in bond-stretching and angle-bending terms. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

To calculate the solvation free energy of a simple ion, it is essential to take into account the polarization of nearby solvent but also the electrostatic potential drop across the liquid\textendash{}gas boundary, however distant. The latter does not exist in a simulation model based on periodic boundary conditions because there is no physical boundary to the system. An important consequence is that the reference value of the electrostatic potential is not an ion in a vacuum. Also, in an infinite system, the electrostatic potential felt by a perturbing charge is conditionally convergent and dependent on the choice of computational conventions. Furthermore, with Ewald lattice summation and tinfoil conducting boundary conditions, the charges experience a spurious shift in the potential that depends on the details of the simulation system such as the volume fraction occupied by the solvent. All these issues can be handled with established computational protocols, as reviewed here and illustrated for several small ions and three solvated proteins.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable advances in computing power, atomistic simulations under nonperiodic boundary conditions, with Coulombic electrostatic interactions and in systems large enough to reduce finite-size associated errors in thermodynamic quantities to within the thermal energy, are still not affordable. As a result, periodic boundary conditions, systems of microscopic size and effective electrostatic interaction functions are frequently resorted to. Ensuing artifacts in thermodynamic quantities are nowadays routinely corrected a posteriori, but the underlying configurational sampling still descends from spurious forces. The present study addresses this problem through the introduction of on-the-fly corrections to the physical forces during an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Two different approaches are suggested, where the force corrections are derived from special potential energy terms. In the first approach, the solvent-generated electrostatic potential sampled at a given atom site is restrained to a target value involving corrections for electrostatic artifacts. In the second approach, the long-range regime of the solvent polarization around a given atom site is restrained to the Born polarization, i.e., the solvent polarization corresponding to the ideal situation of a macroscopic system under nonperiodic boundary conditions and governed by Coulombic electrostatic interactions. The restraints are applied to the explicit-water simulation of a hydrated sodium ion, and the effect of the restraints on the structural and energetic properties of the solvent is illustrated. Furthermore, by means of the calculation of the charging free energy of a hydrated sodium ion, it is shown how the electrostatic potential restraint translates into the on-the-fly consideration of the corresponding free-energy correction terms. It is discussed how the restraints can be generalized to situations involving several solute particles. Although the present study considers a very simple system only, it is an important step toward the on-the-fly elimination of finite-size and approximate-electrostatic artifacts during atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting binding affinities between ligands and macromolecules has been a much sought-after goal. A tremendous amount of resources can be saved in the pharmaceutical industry through accurate binding-affinity prediction and hence correct decision-making for the drug discovery processes. Owing to the structural complexity of macromolecules, one of the issues in binding affinity prediction using molecular dynamics is the adequate sampling of the conformational space. Recently, the funnel metadynamics method (Limongelli et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110:6358, 2013) was developed to enhance the sampling of the ligand at the binding site as well as in the solvated state, and offer the possibility to predict the absolute binding free energy. We apply funnel metadynamics to predict host\textendash{}guest binding affinities for the cucurbit[7]uril host as part of the SAMPL4 blind challenge. Using total simulation times of 300\textendash{}400 ns per ligand, we show that the errors due to inadequate sampling are below 1 kcal/mol. However, despite the large investment in terms of computational time, the results compared to experiment are not better than a random guess. As we obtain differences of up to 11 kcal/mol when switching between two commonly used force fields (with automatically generated parameters), we strongly believe that in the pursuit of accurate binding free energies a more careful force-field parametrization is needed to address this type of system.},

  abstract = {Density functional methods were evaluated in their ability to predict relative conformational energies of a test set of monosubstituted cyclohexanes and six-membered heterocycles. It is shown that while popular density functionals like B3LYP are unreliable for predicting accurate conformational energies for the axial/equatorial equilibrium of monosubstituted cyclohexanes, 1-silacyclohexanes and tetrahydropyrans, density functionals that take into account dispersion interactions like M06-2X and B2PLYP-D result in energy differences close to CCSD(T)/CBS results. Using the M06-2X density functional, we have then investigated the conformational properties of a large number of monosubstituted silacyclohexanes, with the number of silicon atoms ranging from 1 to 6. Our calculations suggest remarkably different conformational properties when compared to cyclohexane. The carbon/silicon exchange in a cyclohexane ring often has systematic, yet counterintuitive effects on the conformational properties. Dispersion interactions are shown to be especially important for accurate relative energy calculations of polysilacyclohexanes.},

  abstract = {It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard "zero-damping" formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional.},

The performance of a variety of ab initio and DFT methods (with and without empirical dispersion corrections) was assessed in detail. Consideration of all pairwise conformer energies provides a performance gauge for both H-bonds and van der Waals interactions, aside from internal strain of angles and bonds. In the post-HF realm, it was found that SCS(MI)CCSD-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 can be a cost-effective alternative to CCSD(T)/CBS, almost without any loss in accuracy. In the DFT arena, the double-hybrid DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ surpasses the accuracy of all other methods (except for SCS(MI)CCSD, but at a small fraction of its cost). Several hybrid functionals provide an acceptable accuracy with the def2-QZVP basis set, especially BMK, M06, LC-\${\o}mega\$PBE-D3, and TPSS0-D3. With the more modest 6-311+G(d,p) basis set, the H-bonds are far from basis set completeness and, due to error compensation, the inclusion of a dispersion correction is generally counterproductive. Some functionals that represent ``Pauling points'' at this level are LC-\${\o}mega\$PBE, TPSS0, B1B95, BMK, TPSSh, PBE0, TPSS, and \${\o}mega\$B97X.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations are increasingly prevalent, complementing experimental studies in all fields of biophysics, chemistry, and materials. Their utility, however, is critically dependent on the validity of the underlying force fields employed. In this Perspective we review the ability of quantum mechanics, and in particular analytical ab initio derivatives, to inform on the nature of intra- and intermolecular interactions. The power inherent in the exploitation of forces and second derivatives (Hessians) to derive force fields for a variety of compound types, including inorganic, organic, and biomolecules, is explored. We discuss the use of these quantities along with QM energies and geometries to determine force constants, including nonbond and electrostatic parameters, and to assess the functional form of the energy surface. The latter includes the optimal form of out-of-plane interactions and the necessity for anharmonicity, and terms to account for coupling between internals, to adequately represent the energy of intramolecular deformations. In addition, individual second derivatives of the energy with respect to selected interaction coordinates, such as interatomic distances or individual dihedral angles, have been shown to select out for the corresponding interactions, annihilating other interactions in the potential expression. Exploitation of these quantities allows one to probe the individual interaction and explore phenomena such as, for example, anisotropy of atom\textendash{}atom nonbonded interactions, charge flux, or the functional form of isolated dihedral angles, e.g., a single dihedral X\textendash{}C\textendash{}C\textendash{}Y about a tetrahedral C\textendash{}C bond.},

  abstract = {The DNA sugar-phosphate backbone has a substantial influence on the DNA structural dynamics. Structural biology and bioinformatics studies revealed that the DNA backbone in experimental structures samples a wide range of distinct conformational substates, known as rotameric DNA backbone conformational families. Their correct description is essential for methods used to model nucleic acids and is known to be the Achilles heel of force field computations. In this study we report the benchmark database of MP2 calculations extrapolated to the complete basis set of atomic orbitals with aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets, MP2(T,Q), augmented by [capital Delta]CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ corrections. The calculations are performed in the gas phase as well as using a COSMO solvent model. This study includes a complete set of 18 established and biochemically most important families of DNA backbone conformations and several other salient conformations that we identified in experimental structures. We utilize an electronically sufficiently complete DNA sugar-phosphate-sugar (SPS) backbone model system truncated to prevent undesired intramolecular interactions. The calculations are then compared with other QM methods. The BLYP and TPSS functionals supplemented with Grimme's D3(BJ) dispersion term provide the best tradeoff between computational demands and accuracy and can be recommended for preliminary conformational searches as well as calculations on large model systems. Among the tested methods, the best agreement with the benchmark database has been obtained for the double-hybrid DSD-BLYP functional in combination with a quadruple-[small zeta] basis set, which is, however, computationally very demanding. The new hybrid density functionals PW6B95-D3 and MPW1B95-D3 yield outstanding results and even slightly outperform the computationally more demanding PWPB95 double-hybrid functional. B3LYP-D3 is somewhat less accurate compared to the other hybrids. Extrapolated MP2(D,T) calculations are not as accurate as the less demanding DFT-D3 methods. Preliminary force field tests using several charge sets reveal an almost order of magnitude larger deviations from the reference QM data compared to modern DFT-D3, underlining the challenges facing force field simulations of nucleic acids. As expected, inclusion of the solvent environment approximated by a continuum approach has a large impact on the relative stabilities of different backbone substates and is important when comparing the QM data with structural bioinformatics and other experimental data.},

Moreover, some existing databases such as S22\texttimes{}5 are extended to shorter intermolecular separations. This improved DFT-D3 training set provides a balanced description of distances, covers the entire range of interaction types, and at 1526 data points is far larger than the original training set of 130. The results are validated against a new collection of 6773 data points and demonstrate that the effect of refitting the damping parameters ranges from no change in accuracy (LC-$\omega$PBE-D3) to an almost 2-fold decrease in average error (PBE-D3).},

When investigating isolated small peptides, the dispersion interaction is the dominant attractive force in the peptide backbone-aromatic side chain intramolecular interaction. Consequently, an accurate theoretical study of these systems requires the use of a methodology covering properly the London dispersion forces. For this reason we have assessed the performance of the MP2, SCS-MP2, MP3, TPSS-D, PBE-D, M06-2X, BH\&H, TPSS, B3LYP, tight-binding DFT-D methods and ff99 empirical force field compared to CCSD(T)/complete basis set (CBS) limit benchmark data. All the DFT techniques with a '-D' symbol have been augmented by empirical dispersion energy while the M06-2X functional was parameterized to cover the London dispersion energy. For the systems here studied we have concluded that the use of the ff99 force field is not recommended mainly due to problems concerning the assignment of reliable atomic charges. Tight-binding DFT-D is efficient as a screening tool providing reliable geometries. Among the DFT functionals, the M06-2X and TPSS-D show the best performance what is explained by the fact that both procedures cover the dispersion energy. The B3LYP and TPSS functionals-not covering this energy-fail systematically. Both, electronic energies and geometries obtained by means of the wave-function theory methods compare satisfactorily with the CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark data.},

These data have then been used to evaluate more approximate methods, including a variety of density functionals both on their own and paired with various empirical dispersion corrections. Owing to the presence of internal contacts of the C\textendash{}H$\cdot\cdot\cdot$O and C\textendash{}H$\cdot\cdot\cdot$N variety, basis set convergence is much slower than for alkane conformers, for example, and basis sets of aug-cc-pVQZ or def2-QZVP quality seem to be required to obtain firm estimates of the basis set limit. Not just HF, but also many DFT functionals, will transpose the two lowest conformers unless empirical dispersion corrections are added. Somewhat surprisingly, many DFT functionals reproduce the reference data to fairly high accuracy when combined with the D3BJ empirical dispersion correction or the ``nonlocal'' Vydrov\textendash{}Van Voorhis dispersion model. The two best performers including dispersion corrections are the double hybrids DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ and B2GP-PLYP-D; if no such correction is permitted, then M06-2X puts in the best performance.

  abstract = {Conformational change in protein\textendash{}ligand complexes is widely modeled, but the protein accommodation expected on binding a congeneric series of ligands has received less attention. Given their use in medicinal chemistry, there are surprisingly few substantial series of congeneric ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we determine the structures of eight alkyl benzenes, in single-methylene increases from benzene to n-hexylbenzene, bound to an enclosed cavity in T4 lysozyme. The volume of the apo cavity suffices to accommodate benzene but, even with toluene, larger cavity conformations become observable in the electron density, and over the series two other major conformations are observed. These involve discrete changes in main-chain conformation, expanding the site; few continuous changes in the site are observed. In most structures, two discrete protein conformations are observed simultaneously, and energetic considerations suggest that these conformations are low in energy relative to the ground state. An analysis of 121 lysozyme cavity structures in the PDB finds that these three conformations dominate the previously determined structures, largely modeled in a single conformation. An investigation of the few congeneric series in the PDB suggests that discrete changes are common adaptations to a series of growing ligands. The discrete, but relatively few, conformational states observed here, and their energetic accessibility, may have implications for anticipating protein conformational change in ligand design.},

The approach is shown to facilitate sampling in these challenging cases where high free energy barriers separate the initial and final conformations and leads to superior convergence of the free energy as demonstrated both by consistency of the results (independence from the starting conformation) and agreement with experimental binding affinity data. The second case, consisting of two neutral thrombin ligands that are taken from a recent medicinal chemistry program for this interesting pharmaceutical target, is of particular significance in that it demonstrates that good results can be obtained for large, complex ligands, as opposed to relatively simple model systems. To achieve quantitative agreement with experiment in the thrombin case, a next generation force field, Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations 2.0, is required, which provides superior charges and torsional parameters as compared to earlier alternatives.},

  abstract = {Molecular docking computationally screens thousands to millions of organic molecules against protein structures, looking for those with complementary fits. Many approximations are made, often resulting in low ``hit rates.'' A strategy to overcome these approximations is to rescore top-ranked docked molecules using a better but slower method. One such is afforded by molecular mechanics\textendash{}generalized Born surface area (MM\textendash{}GBSA) techniques. These more physically realistic methods have improved models for solvation and electrostatic interactions and conformational change compared to most docking programs. To investigate MM\textendash{}GBSA rescoring, we re-ranked docking hit lists in three small buried sites: a hydrophobic cavity that binds apolar ligands, a slightly polar cavity that binds aryl and hydrogen-bonding ligands, and an anionic cavity that binds cationic ligands. These sites are simple; consequently, incorrect predictions can be attributed to particular errors in the method, and many likely ligands may actually be tested. In retrospective calculations, MM\textendash{}GBSA techniques with binding-site minimization better distinguished the known ligands for each cavity from the known decoys compared to the docking calculation alone. This encouraged us to test rescoring prospectively on molecules that ranked poorly by docking but that ranked well when rescored by MM\textendash{}GBSA. A total of 33 molecules highly ranked by MM\textendash{}GBSA for the three cavities were tested experimentally. Of these, 23 were observed to bind\textemdash{}these are docking false negatives rescued by rescoring. The 10 remaining molecules are true negatives by docking and false positives by MM\textendash{}GBSA. X-ray crystal structures were determined for 21 of these 23 molecules. In many cases, the geometry prediction by MM\textendash{}GBSA improved the initial docking pose and more closely resembled the crystallographic result; yet in several cases, the rescored geometry failed to capture large conformational changes in the protein. Intriguingly, rescoring not only rescued docking false positives, but also introduced several new false positives into the top-ranking molecules. We consider the origins of the successes and failures in MM\textendash{}GBSA rescoring in these model cavity sites and the prospects for rescoring in biologically relevant targets.},

  abstract = {A model binding site was used to investigate charge\textendash{}charge interactions in molecular docking. This simple site, a small (180 {\AA}3) engineered cavity in cyctochrome c peroxidase (CCP), is negatively charged and completely buried from solvent, allowing us to explore the balance between electrostatic energy and ligand desolvation energy in a system where many of the common approximations in docking do not apply. A database with about 5300 molecules was docked into this cavity. Retrospective testing with known ligands and decoys showed that overall the balance between electrostatic interaction and desolvation energy was captured. More interesting were prospective docking scre"ens that looked for novel ligands, especially those that might reveal problems with the docking and energy methods. Based on screens of the 5300 compound database, both high-scoring and low-scoring molecules were acquired and tested for binding. Out of 16 new, high-scoring compounds tested, 15 were observed to bind. All of these were small heterocyclic cations. Binding constants were measured for a few of these, they ranged between 20 $\mu$M and 60 $\mu$M. Crystal structures were determined for ten of these ligands in complex with the protein. The observed ligand geometry corresponded closely to that predicted by docking. Several low-scoring alkyl amino cations were also tested and found to bind. The low docking score of these molecules owed to the relatively high charge density of the charged amino group and the corresponding high desolvation penalty. When the complex structures of those ligands were determined, a bound water molecule was observed interacting with the amino group and a backbone carbonyl group of the cavity. This water molecule mitigates the desolvation penalty and improves the interaction energy relative to that of the ``naked'' site used in the docking screen. Finally, six low-scoring neutral molecules were also tested, with a view to looking for false negative predictions. Whereas most of these did not bind, two did (phenol and 3-fluorocatechol). Crystal structures for these two ligands in complex with the cavity site suggest reasons for their binding. That these neutral molecules do, in fact bind, contradicts previous results in this site and, along with the alkyl amines, provides instructive false negatives that help identify weaknesses in our scoring functions. Several improvements of these are considered.},

  abstract = {Prediction of interaction energies between ligands and their receptors remains a major challenge for structure-based inhibitor discovery. Much effort has been devoted to developing scoring schemes that can successfully rank the affinities of a diverse set of possible ligands to a binding site for which the structure is known. To test these scoring functions, well-characterized experimental systems can be very useful. Here, mutation-created binding sites in T4 lysozyme were used to investigate how the quality of atomic charges and solvation energies affects molecular docking. Atomic charges and solvation energies were calculated for 172,118 molecules in the Available Chemicals Directory using a semi-empirical quantum mechanical approach by the program AMSOL\textdagger\textdagger{}http://t1.chem.umn.edu/amsol
. The database was first screened against the apolar cavity site created by the mutation Leu99$\rightarrow$Ala (L99A). Compared to the electronegativity-based charges that are widely used, the new charges and desolvation energies improved ranking of known apolar ligands, and better distinguished them from more polar isosteres that are not observed to bind. To investigate whether the new charges had predictive value, the non-polar residue Met102, which forms part of the binding site, was changed to the polar residue glutamine. The structure of the resulting Leu99$\rightarrow$Ala and Met102$\rightarrow$Gln double mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q) was determined and the docking calculation was repeated for the new site. Seven representative polar molecules that preferentially docked to the polar versus the apolar binding site were tested experimentally. All seven bind to the polar cavity (L99A/M102Q) but do not detectably bind to the apolar cavity (L99A). Five ligand-bound structures of L99A/M102Q were determined by X-ray crystallography. Docking predictions corresponded to the crystallographic results to within 0.4 {\AA} RMSD. Improved treatment of partial atomic charges and desolvation energies in database docking appears feasible and leads to better distinction of true ligands. Simple model binding sites, such as L99A and its more polar variants, may find broad use in the development and testing of docking algorithms.},

  abstract = {We present a method to identify small molecule ligand binding sites and poses within a given protein crystal structure using GPU-accelerated Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The Hamiltonians used vary from the physical end state of protein interacting with the ligand to an unphysical end state where the ligand does not interact with the protein. As replicas explore the space of Hamiltonians interpolating between these states, the ligand can rapidly escape local minima and explore potential binding sites. Geometric restraints keep the ligands from leaving the vicinity of the protein and an alchemical pathway designed to increase phase space overlap between intermediates ensures good mixing. Because of the rigorous statistical mechanical nature of the Hamiltonian exchange framework, we can also extract binding free energy estimates for all putative binding sites. We present results of this methodology applied to the T4 lysozyme L99A model system for three known ligands and one non-binder as a control, using an implicit solvent. We find that our methodology identifies known crystallographic binding sites consistently and accurately for the small number of ligands considered here and gives free energies consistent with experiment. We are also able to analyze the contribution of individual binding sites to the overall binding affinity. Our methodology points to near term potential applications in early-stage structure-guided drug discovery.},

  abstract = {We report here NMR and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry studies of the binding of ionisable guests (carboxylate acids) to a deep-cavity cavitand. These studies reveal that the shortest guests favoured 1:1 complex formation, but the longer the alkyl chain the more the 2:1 host-guest capsule is favoured. For intermediate-sized guests, the equilibrium between these two states is controlled by pH; at low values the capsule containing the carboxylic acid guest is favoured, whereas as the pH is raised deprotonation of the guest favours the 1:1 complex. Interestingly, for one host\textendash{}guest pair the energy required to decap the 2:1 capsular complex and form the 1:1 complex is sufficient to shift the pKa of the guest by 3\textendash{}4 orders of magnitude (4.1\textendash{}5.4 kcal mol-1). The two largest guests examined form stable 2:1 capsules, with in both cases the guest adopting a relatively high energy J-shaped motif. Furthermore, these 2:1 complexes are sufficiently stable that at high pH guest deprotonation occurs without decapping of the capsule.},

  abstract = {We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol. In addition, we computed "relative" binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and 1.2 A (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based absolute binding free energy methods.},

Alchemical binding free energy calculations, one potential tool for rational design, have progressed rapidly over the past decade, but still fall short of providing robust tools for pharmaceutical engineering. Recent studies, especially on model receptor systems, have clarified many of the challenges that must be overcome for robust predictions of binding affinity to be useful in rational design. In this review, inspired by a recent joint academic/industry meeting organized by the authors, we discuss these challenges and suggest a number of promising approaches for overcoming them.},

In these studies, entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding are observed to vary substantially and in an opposing manner as the ligand or protein is modified, whereas the binding free energy varies little. In severe examples, engineered enthalpic gains can lead to completely compensating entropic penalties, frustrating ligand design. Here, we examine the evidence for compensation, as well as its potential origins, prevalence, severity, and ramifications for ligand engineering. We find the evidence for severe compensation to be weak in light of the large magnitude of and correlation between errors in experimental measurements of entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding, though a limited form of compensation may be common. Given the difficulty of predicting or measuring entropic and enthalpic changes to useful precision,...},

These are promising tools for lead optimization in drug discovery, computing changes in binding free energy due to modifications of a lead compound. However, in the ``alchemical'' framework for RBFE calculations, some types of mutations have the potential to introduce error into the computed binding free energies. Here we explore the magnitude of this error in several different model binding calculations. We find that some of the calculations involving ring breaking have significant errors, and these errors are especially large in bridged ring systems. Since the error is a function of ligand strain, which is unpredictable in advance, we believe that ring breaking should be avoided when possible.},

Our approach analyzes both backbone and side chain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant.

Here, we explore these hydration effects for some hypothetical neutral solutes, and two real solutes, with molecular dynamics simulations using several different water models. We find that, like ions, polar solutes are solvated differently in water depending on the sign of the partial charges. Solutes having a large negative charge balancing diffuse positive charges are preferentially solvated relative to those having a large positive charge balancing diffuse negative charges. Asymmetries in hydration free energies can be as large as 10 kcal/mol for neutral benzene-sized solutes. These asymmetries are mainly enthalpic, aris...},

Overall, we found good correlations with experimental values which were subsequently made available, but the variances are large compared to those in previous tests. We tested several different charge models and found that several standard charge models performed relatively well.

The new anisotropic model allows us to simulate both strong beta-sheet and weaker attachment bonds between proteins. Constraining binding directions allows us to generate aggregate structures with the hexagonal lattice symmetry found in recently observed in vitro experiments. We argue that these constraints on rules may correspond to underlying steric constraints on the aggregation process. We find that monomer-dominated growth of the areal aggregate is too slow to account for some observed doubling-time-to-incubation-time ratios inferred from data, and so consider aggregation dominated by relatively stable but noninfectious oligomeric intermediates. We compare a kinetic theory analysis of oligomeric aggregation to spatially explicit simulations of the process. We find that with suitable rules for misfolding of oligomers, possibly due to water exclusion by the surrounding aggregate, the resulting oligomeric aggregation model maps onto our previous monomer aggregation model. Therefore it can produce some of the same attractive features for the description of prion incubation time data. We propose experiments to test the oligomeric aggregation model.},

We examine insertion of the regular Abeta peptide as well as mutants causing familial Alzheimer's disease, and find that all but one of the mutants change the insertion behavior by causing the peptide to spend more simulation steps in only one leaflet of the bilayer. We also find that Abeta42, because of the extra hydrophobic residues relative to Abeta40, is more likely to adopt this conformation than Abeta40 in both wild-type and mutant forms. We argue qualitatively why these effects happen. Here, we present our results and develop the hypothesis that this partial insertion increases the probability of harmful channel formation. This hypothesis can partly explain why these mutations are neurotoxic simply due to peptide insertion behavior. We further apply this model to various artificial Abeta mutants which have been examined experimentally, and offer testable experimental predictions contrasting the roles of aggregation and insertion with regard to toxicity of Abeta mutants. These can be used through further experiments to test our hypothesis.},

Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking.

The methodology is validated by computing the solvation free energy of ibuprofen in water, methanol, and ethanol at 300 K and 1 bar and comparing to reference simulation results using Bennett's acceptance ratio method. Difficulties with ibuprofen using conventional molecular dynamics methods stem from an inadequate sampling of the carboxylic acid functional group, which, for the present study, is subject to free energy barriers of rotation of 14\textendash{}20 kBT. While several advances have been made to overcome such weaknesses, we demonstrate how this shortcoming is easily overcome by using an expanded ensemble methodology to facilitate conformational sampling.

  abstract = {Hydration free energy calculations in explicit solvent have become an integral part of binding free energy calculations and a valuable test of force fields. Most of these simulations follow the conventional norm of keeping edge length of the periodic solvent box larger than twice the Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff distance, with the rationale that this should be sufficient to keep the interactions between copies of the solute to a minimum. However, for charged solutes, hydration free energies can exhibit substantial box size-dependence even at typical box sizes. Here, we examine whether similar size-dependence affects hydration of neutral molecules. Thus, we focused on two strongly polar molecules with large dipole moments, where any size-dependence should be most pronounced, and determined how their hydration free energies vary as a function of simulation box size. In addition to testing a variety of simulation box sizes, we also tested two LJ cut-off distances, 0.65 and 1.0~nm. We show from these simulations that the calculated hydration free energy is independent of the box-size as well as the LJ cut-off distance, suggesting that typical hydration free energy calculations of neutral compounds indeed need not be particularly concerned with finite-size effects as long as standard good practices are followed.},

  doi = {10.1002/jcc.23490},
  abstract = {The calculation of binding free energies of charged species to a target molecule is a frequently encountered problem in molecular dynamics studies of (bio-)chemical thermodynamics. Many important endogenous receptor-binding molecules, enzyme substrates, or drug molecules have a nonzero net charge. Absolute binding free energies, as well as binding free energies relative to another molecule with a different net charge will be affected by artifacts due to the used effective electrostatic interaction function and associated parameters (e.g., size of the computational box). In the present study, charging contributions to binding free energies of small oligoatomic ions to a series of model host cavities functionalized with different chemical groups are calculated with classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Electrostatic interactions are treated using a lattice-summation scheme or a cutoff-truncation scheme with Barker\textendash{}Watts reaction-field correction, and the simulations are conducted in boxes of different edge lengths. It is illustrated that the charging free energies of the guest molecules in water and in the host strongly depend on the applied methodology and that neglect of correction terms for the artifacts introduced by the finite size of the simulated system and the use of an effective electrostatic interaction function considerably impairs the thermodynamic interpretation of guest-host interactions. Application of correction terms for the various artifacts yields consistent results for the charging contribution to binding free energies and is thus a prerequisite for the valid interpretation or prediction of experimental data via molecular dynamics simulation. Analysis and correction of electrostatic artifacts according to the scheme proposed in the present study should therefore be considered an integral part of careful free-energy calculation studies if changes in the net charge are involved. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors Journal of Computational Chemistry Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  volume = {139},
  doi = {10.1063/1.4826261},
  abstract = {The calculation of a protein-ligand binding free energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system, both in the solvated protein and free in solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free energies are typically calculated in nanoscale computational boxes simulated under periodic boundary conditions and considering electrostatic interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a system of macroscopic size simulated under non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the charging component of the insertion free energy, are dependent on the box size, and can be large when the ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein is charged as well. This article investigates finite-size effects on calculated charging free energies using as a test case the binding of the ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in water. Considering different charge isoforms of the protein (net charges -5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in the absence or the presence of neutralizing counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ\,mol-1) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are then proposed to eliminate these effects, a numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the latter at the box size considered in the MD simulations, the analytical scheme only requires three non-periodic PB calculations for a given system, its dependence on the box size being analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight into the physical origin of the finite-size effects. These two schemes also encompass a correction for discrete solvent effects that persists even in the limit of infinite box sizes. Application of either scheme essentially eliminates the size dependence of the corrected charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ\,mol-1). Because it is simple to apply, the analytical correction scheme offers a general solution to the problem of finite-size effects in free-energy calculations involving charged solutes, as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g., protein-ligand binding, biomolecular association, residue mutation, pKa and redox potential estimation, substrate transformation, solvation, and solvent-solvent partitioning.},

  doi = {10.1021/jp0735987},
  abstract = {In simulations, molecular dispersion interactions are frequently neglected beyond a cutoff of around 1 nm. In some cases, analytical corrections appropriate for isotropic systems are applied to the pressure and/or the potential energy. Here, we show that in systems containing macromolecules, either of these approaches introduce statistically significant errors in some observed properties; for example, the choice of cutoff can affect computed free energies of ligand binding to proteins by 1 to 2 kcal/mol. We review current methods for eliminating this cutoff-dependent behavior of the dispersion energy and identify some situations where they fail. We introduce two new formalisms, appropriate for binding free energy calculations, which overcome these failings, requiring minimal computational effort beyond the time required to run the original simulation. When these cutoff approximations are applied, which can be done after all simulations are completed, results are consistent across simulations run with different cutoffs. In many situations, simulations can be run with even shorter cutoffs than typically used, resulting in increased computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma, the most malignant form of brain cancer, is responsible for 23\% of primary brain tumors and has extremely poor outcome. Confounding the clinical management of glioblastomas is the extreme local invasiveness of these cancer cells. The mechanisms that govern invasion are poorly understood. To gain insight into glioblastoma invasion, we conducted experiments on the patterns of growth and dispersion of U87 glioblastoma tumor spheroids in a three-dimensional collagen gel. We studied two different cell lines, one with a mutation to the EGFR (U87DeltaEGFR) that is associated with increased malignancy, and one with an endogenous (wild-type) receptor (U87WT). We developed a continuum mathematical model of the dispersion behaviors with the aim of identifying and characterizing discrete cellular mechanisms underlying invasive cell motility. The mathematical model quantitatively reproduces the experimental data, and indicates that the U87WT invasive cells have a stronger directional motility bias away from the spheroid center as well as a faster rate of cell shedding compared to the U87DeltaEGFR cells. The model suggests that differences in tumor cell dispersion may be due to differences in the chemical factors produced by cells, differences in how the two cell lines remodel the gel, or different cell-cell adhesion characteristics.},

In this study we compare the performance of linear and several nonlinear transformation methods, among them separation shifted "soft core" scaling, for a popular test system, the hydration free energy of an amino acid side chain. All the nonlinear methods yield similar results if extensive sampling is performed, but soft core scaling provides smooth lambda curves that are best suited for commonly used numerical integration schemes.

Specifically, we focus on estimating a set of force-field parameters for the four-site, TIP4P, water model, based on a synthetic problem involving isothermal, isobaric molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water at ambient conditions. We exploit the polynomial chaos (PC) expansions developed in Part I as surrogate representations of three macroscale observables, namely density, self-diffusion, and enthalpy, as a function of the force-field parameters. We analyze and discuss the use of two different PC representations in a Bayesian framework for the inference of atomistic parameters, based on synthetic observations of three macroscale observables. The first surrogate is a deterministic PC representation, constructed in Part I using nonintrusive spectral projection (NISP). An alternative strategy exploits a nondeterministic PC representation obtained using Bayesian inference of PC coefficients. We analyze the sensitivity of selected force-field parameters to the macroscale data, namely by exploiting the surrogate models to derive suitable ``response'' surfaces in the space of random parameters. The performance of both inference strategies is then examined in light of this analysis. The results show that each parameter is very sensitive to certain observables, while being only minimally affected by others.  We show that a suitable choice of the observables allows us to recover the presumed ``true'' set of parameters with high accuracy even with low-order surrogate models.},

Fluid simulations are required in which one solute is mutated to the other in both solvents, and the changes in free energies of solvation are computed. The method is illustrated for eight pairs of organic solutes partitioningbetween water and chloroform. Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations are used with statistical perturbation theory to calculate the requisite free energy changes. The results are compared with experimental log P data and relative free energies of hydration. For the present solute pairs, the differences in partition coefficients are dominated by the differences in hydration. Such computations are useful for providing estimates of the effects of substituent changes on partitioning behavior and for further testing of intermolecular potential functions.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION:Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources. RESULTS:Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.

  abstract = {Experimental data on the transfer of small molecules between vacuum and water are relatively sparse. This makes it difficult to assess whether computational methods are truly predictive of this important quantity or merely good at explaining what has been seen. To explore this, a prospective test was performed of two different methods for estimating solvation free energies: an implicit solvent approach based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and an explicit solvent approach using alchemical free energy calculations. For a set of 17 small molecules, root mean square errors from experiment were between 1.3 and 2.6 kcal/mol, with the explicit solvent free energy approach yielding somewhat greater accuracy but at greater computational expense. Insights from outliers and suggestions for future prospective challenges of this kind are presented.},

Here, we evaluate the predictive power of the Generalized Amber Force Field (Wang et al. J. Comput. Chem. 2004, 25, 1157-1174) for the Gibbs energy of solvation of organic molecules in organic solvents using the thermodynamics integration (TI) method. The results are compared to experimental data, to a model based on quantitative structure property relations (QSPR), and to the conductor-like screening models for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS) model. Although the TI calculations yield slightly better correlation to experimental results than the other models, in all fairness we should conclude that the difference between the models is minor since both QSPR and COSMO-RS yield a slightly lower RMSD from that of the experiment ($<$3.5 kJ/mol). By analyzing which molecules (either as solvents or solutes) are outliers in the TI calculations, we can pinpoint where additional parametrization efforts are needed. For the force field based TI calculations, deviations from the experiment occur in particular when compounds containing nitro or ester groups are solvated into other liquids, suggesting that the interaction between these groups and solvents may be too strong. In the COSMO-RS calculations, outliers mainly occur when compounds containing (in particular aromatic) rings are solvated despite using a ring correction term in the calculations.},

Fluid simulations are required in which one solute is mutated to the other in both solvents, and the changes in free energies of solvation are computed. The method is illustrated for eight pairs of organic solutes partitioningbetween water and chloroform. Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations are used with statistical perturbation theory to calculate the requisite free energy changes. The results are compared with experimental log P data and relative free energies of hydration. For the present solute pairs, the differences in partition coefficients are dominated by the differences in hydration. Such computations are useful for providing estimates of the effects of substituent changes on partitioning behavior and for further testing of intermolecular potential functions. The paper also contains previously unreported potential function parameters for acetic acid, methyl acetate, acetone, and pyrimidine and a summary of thermodynamicsresults for the correspondingpure liquids.},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

Model. 2010, 50, 572.), and tested the performance of our conformer generator, OMEGA, on these sets. In the present publication, we focus on understanding the suitability of those data sets for validation and identifying and learning from OMEGA's failures. We compare, for the first time we are aware of, the coverage of the applicable property spaces between the validation data sets we used and the parent compound sets to determine if our data sets adequately sample these property spaces. We also introduce the concept of torsion fingerprinting and compare this method of dissimilation to the more traditional graph-centric diversification methods we used in our previous publication. To improve our ability to programmatically identify cases where the crystallographic conformation is not well reproduced computationally, we introduce a new metric to compare conformations, RMSTanimoto. This new metric is used alongside those from our previous publication to efficiently identify reproduction failures. We find RMSTanimoto to be particularly effective in identifying failures for the smallest molecules in our data sets. Analysis of the nature of these failures, particularly those for the CSD, sheds further light on the issue of strain in crystallographic structures. Some of the residual failure cases not resolved by simple changes in OMEGA's defaults present significant challenges to conformer generation engines like OMEGA and are a source of new avenues to further improve their performance, while others illustrate the pitfalls of validating against crystallographic ligand conformations, particularly those from the PDB.},

Solubility in general is extremely important, both for theoretical reasons - it provides an important probe of the balance between solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions - and for more practical reasons, such as how to control the solubility of a given solute via modulation of its environment, as in process chemistry and separations. Here, we study how the change of solvent affects the solubility of a given compound. That is, we calculate relative solubilities. We use MD simulations to calculate relative solubility and compare our calculated values with experiment as well as with results from several other methods, SMD and UNIFAC, the latter of which is commonly used in chemical engineering design. We find that straightforward solubility calculations based on molecular simulations using a general small-molecule force field outperform SMD and UNIFAC both in terms of accuracy and coverage of the relevant chemical space.},

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {The discovery of various protein/receptor targets from genomic research is expanding rapidly. Along with the automation of organic synthesis and biochemical screening, this is bringing a major change in the whole field of drug discovery research. In the traditional drug discovery process, the industry tests compounds in the thousands. With automated synthesis, the number of compounds to be tested could be in the millions. This two-dimensional expansion will lead to a major demand for resources, unless the chemical libraries are made wisely. The objective of this work is to provide both quantitative and qualitative characterization of known drugs which will help to generate "drug-like" libraries. In this work we analyzed the Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (CMC) database and seven different subsets belonging to different classes of drug molecules. These include some central nervous system active drugs and cardiovascular, cancer, inflammation, and infection disease states. A quantitative characterization based on computed physicochemical property profiles such as log P, molar refractivity, molecular weight, and number of atoms as well as a qualitative characterization based on the occurrence of functional groups and important substructures are developed here. For the CMC database, the qualifying range (covering more than 80\% of the compounds) of the calculated log P is between -0.4 and 5.6, with an average value of 2.52. For molecular weight, the qualifying range is between 160 and 480, with an average value of 357. For molar refractivity, the qualifying range is between 40 and 130, with an average value of 97. For the total number of atoms, the qualifying range is between 20 and 70, with an average value of 48. Benzene is by far the most abundant substructure in this drug database, slightly more abundant than all the heterocyclic rings combined. Nonaromatic heterocyclic rings are twice as abundant as the aromatic heterocycles. Tertiary aliphatic amines, alcoholic OH and carboxamides are the most abundant functional groups in the drug database. The effective range of physicochemical properties presented here can be used in the design of drug-like combinatorial libraries as well as in developing a more efficient corporate medicinal chemistry library.},

We tested two different solvent models, TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew, and obtained very similar hydration free energies for these two models; the RMS difference was 0.64 kcal/mol. We found that preferred conformation of the carboxylic acids in water differs from that in vacuum. Surprisingly, this conformational change is not adequately sampled on simulation timescales, so we apply an umbrella sampling technique to include free energies associated with the conformational change. Overall, the results of this test reveal that the force field parameters for some groups of molecules (such as hydroxyl-rich compounds) still need to be improved, but for most compounds, accuracy was consistent with that seen in our previous tests.},

In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files. The package is distributed as free software and can be downloaded from http://www.ime.unicamp.br/$\backslash$textasciitildemartinez/packmol/.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen\textendash{}oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10822-014-9766-7},
  abstract = {Hydration free energy calculations in explicit solvent have become an integral part of binding free energy calculations and a valuable test of force fields. Most of these simulations follow the conventional norm of keeping edge length of the periodic solvent box larger than twice the Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff distance, with the rationale that this should be sufficient to keep the interactions between copies of the solute to a minimum. However, for charged solutes, hydration free energies can exhibit substantial box size-dependence even at typical box sizes. Here, we examine whether similar size-dependence affects hydration of neutral molecules. Thus, we focused on two strongly polar molecules with large dipole moments, where any size-dependence should be most pronounced, and determined how their hydration free energies vary as a function of simulation box size. In addition to testing a variety of simulation box sizes, we also tested two LJ cut-off distances, 0.65 and 1.0 nm. We show from these simulations that the calculated hydration free energy is independent of the box-size as well as the LJ cut-off distance, suggesting that typical hydration free energy calculations of neutral compounds indeed need not be particularly concerned with finite-size effects as long as standard good practices are followed.},

  doi = {10.1021/ct800409d},
  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics free energy simulations with TIP3P explicit solvent, we compute the hydration free energies of 504 neutral small organic molecules and compare them to experiments. We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an RMS error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 kT) and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds, and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a Lennard-Jones well depth, and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the non-polar component of hydration free energies - that is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the non-polar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total non-polar free energy does not scale with the solute surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free energies and components will be valuable to others in future development of force fields and solvation models.},

GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 A, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 A) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 A, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 A and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.},

Here, we present the estimation of solvation free energies in polar (water, hexanol, octanol, and nonanol) and in apolar (hexane, octane, and nonane) media. The estimates are produced using molecular dynamics simulations employing a simple all-atom/coarse-grained hybrid model (AA/ELBA) and are therefore very efficient. More than 150 solutes were taken from the Minnesota solvation database and represent small, organic molecules. The mean absolute deviation for the different solvents ranges between 2.0 and 4.1 kJ/mol, and the correlation coefficient ranges between 0.78 and 0.99, indicating that the predictions are accurate. Outliers are identified, and potential avenues for improvements are discussed. Furthermore, partition coefficients between water and the organic solvents were estimated, and the percentage of the predictions that has the correct sign ranges between 74\% (for octane) and 92\% (for octanol and hexanol). Finally, membrane/water partition coefficients are replaced with hexane/water and octanol/water partition coefficients, and the latter is found to be as accurate as the expensive membrane calculations, indicating a wider application area.},

High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

  abstract = {Hydration free energy calculations have become important tests of force fields. Alchemical free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations provide a rigorous way to calculate these free energies for a particular force field, given sufficient sampling. Here, we report results of alchemical hydration free energy calculations for the set of small molecules comprising the 2011 Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands challenge. Our calculations are largely based on the Generalized Amber Force Field with several different charge models, and we achieved RMS errors in the 1.4-2.2 kcal/mol range depending on charge model, marginally higher than what we typically observed in previous studies (Mobley et al. in J Phys Chem B 111(9):2242-2254, 2007, J Chem Theory Comput 5(2):350-358, 2009, J Phys Chem B 115:1329-1332, 2011; Nicholls et al. in J Med Chem 51:769-779, 2008; Klimovich and Mobley in J Comput Aided Mol Design 24(4):307-316, 2010). The test set consists of ethane, biphenyl, and a dibenzyl dioxin, as well as a series of chlorinated derivatives of each. We found that, for this set, using high-quality partial charges from MP2/cc-PVTZ SCRF RESP fits provided marginally improved agreement with experiment over using AM1-BCC partial charges as we have more typically done, in keeping with our recent findings (Mobley et al. in J Phys Chem B 115:1329-1332, 2011). Switching to OPLS Lennard-Jones parameters with AM1-BCC charges also improves agreement with experiment. We also find a number of chemical trends within each molecular series which we can explain, but there are also some surprises, including some that are captured by the calculations and some that are not.},

These rates can be estimated using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model, which requires calculation of the potential of mean force and position-dependent diffusivity of the solute along the transmembrane axis. In this paper, we assess the efficiency and accuracy of several methods for the calculation of the permeability of a model DMPC bilayer to urea, benzoic acid, and codeine. We compare umbrella sampling, replica exchange umbrella sampling, adaptive biasing force, and multiple-walker adaptive biasing force for the calculation of the transmembrane PMF. No definitive advantage for any of these methods in their ability to predict the membrane permeability coefficient Pm was found, provided that a sufficiently long equilibration is performed. For diffusivities, a Bayesian inference method was compared to a generalized Langevin method, both being sensitive to chosen parameters and the slow relaxation of membrane defects. Agreement within 1.5 log units of the computed Pm with experiment is found for all permeants and methods. Remaining discrepancies can likely be attributed to limitations of the force field as well as slowly relaxing collective movements within the lipid environment. Numerical calculations based on model profiles show that Pm can be reliably estimated from only a few data points, leading to recommendations for calculating Pm from simulations.},

We meet the challenge by quantifying the statistical natures of the relevant physical variables of biomolecular recognition using the analytical model combined with microscopic flexible docking simulation methods. We uncovered the universal statistical laws obeyed by the affinity, equilibrium constant, intrinsic specificity and kinetics for biomolecular recognition. The general statistical laws based on energy landscape theory can serve as a conceptual framework for molecular recognition in biological repertoires. They can be applied to molecular selection, in vitro evolution process, high throughput screening and virtual screening for drug discovery. The statistical laws in combinations with experiments provide quantitative signatures of a specific ligand binding to a specific receptor, these resultant laws as a guideline will contribute to drug design against a specific target. Our developed statistical methodology is general and applicable for all other biomolecular recognitions.},

In principle, molecular simulations methodologies that compute free energies of binding do capture nonadditivity of protein\textendash{}ligand interactions, but efficient protocols are necessary to compute well-converged free energies of binding that clearly resolve nonadditive effects. To this end, an efficient GPU-accelerated implementation of alchemical free energy calculations has been developed and applied to two congeneric series of ligands of the enzyme thrombin. The results show that accurate binding affinities are computed across the two congeneric series and positive coupling between nonpolar R1 substituents and a X = NH3+ substituent is reproduced, albeit with a weaker trend than experimentally observed. By contrast, a docking methodology completely fails to capture nonadditive effects. Further analysis shows that the nonadditive effects are partly due to variations in the strength of a hydrogen-bond between the X = NH3+ ligands family and thrombin residue Gly216. However, other partially compensating interactions occur across the entire binding site, and no single interaction dictates the magnitude of the nonadditive effects for all the analyzed protein\textendash{}ligand complexes.},

Although purely synthetic systems with larger association constants have been reported, the present one is unique because it does not rely on polyvalency. Instead, it achieves its extreme affinity by overcoming the compensatory enthalpy\textendash{}entropy relationship usually observed in supramolecular complexes. Its disproportionately low entropic cost is traced to extensive host desolvation and to the rigidity of both the host and the guest.},

  abstract = {The computational prediction of protein\textendash{}ligand binding affinities is of central interest in early-stage drug-discovery, and there is a widely recognized need for improved methods. Low molecular weight receptors and their ligands\textemdash{}i.e., host\textendash{}guest systems\textemdash{}represent valuable test-beds for such affinity prediction methods, because their small size makes for fast calculations and relatively facile numerical convergence. The SAMPL3 community exercise included the first ever blind prediction challenge for host\textendash{}guest binding affinities, through the incorporation of 11 new host\textendash{}guest complexes. Ten participating research groups addressed this challenge with a variety of approaches. Statistical assessment indicates that, although most methods performed well at predicting some general trends in binding affinity, overall accuracy was not high, as all the methods suffered from either poor correlation or high RMS errors or both. There was no clear advantage in using explicit versus implicit solvent models, any particular force field, or any particular approach to conformational sampling. In a few cases, predictions using very similar energy models but different sampling and/or free-energy methods resulted in significantly different results. The protonation states of one host and some guest molecules emerged as key uncertainties beyond the choice of computational approach. The present results have implications for methods development and future blind prediction exercises.},

  abstract = {Molecular docking is a powerful tool used in drug discovery and structural biology for predicting the structures of ligand\textendash{}receptor complexes. However, the accuracy of docking calculations can be limited by factors such as the neglect of protein reorganization in the scoring function; as a result, ligand screening can produce a high rate of false positive hits. Although absolute binding free energy methods still have difficulty in accurately rank-ordering binders, we believe that they can be fruitfully employed to distinguish binders from nonbinders and reduce the false positive rate. Here we study a set of ligands that dock favorably to a newly discovered, potentially allosteric site on the flap of HIV-1 protease. Fragment binding to this site stabilizes a closed form of protease, which could be exploited for the design of allosteric inhibitors. Twenty-three top-ranked protein\textendash{}ligand complexes from AutoDock were subject to the free energy screening using two methods, the recently developed binding energy analysis method (BEDAM) and the standard double decoupling method (DDM). Free energy calculations correctly identified most of the false positives ($\geq$83\%) and recovered all the confirmed binders. The results show a gap averaging $\geq$3.7 kcal/mol, separating the binders and the false positives. We present a formula that decomposes the binding free energy into contributions from the receptor conformational macrostates, which provides insights into the roles of different binding modes. Our binding free energy component analysis further suggests that improving the treatment for the desolvation penalty associated with the unfulfilled polar groups could reduce the rate of false positive hits in docking. The current study demonstrates that the combination of docking with free energy methods can be very useful for more accurate ligand screening against valuable drug targets.},

  abstract = {An important unsolved problem in materials science is prediction of the thermodynamic stability of organic crystals and their solubility from first principles. Solubility can be defined as the saturating concentration of a molecule within a liquid solvent, where the physical picture is of solvated molecules in equilibrium with their solid phase. Despite the importance of solubility in determining the oral bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, prediction tools are currently limited to quantitative structure\textendash{}property relationships that are fit to experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a consistent procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals from molecular dynamics simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. Our approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the sum of solid\textendash{}vapor sublimation and vapor\textendash{}liquid solvation free energies $\Delta$Gsolubility$^\circ$ = $\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ + $\Delta$Gsolv$^\circ$, which are computed via the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to the n-alkylamides series from acetamide through octanamide was selected due to the dependence of their solubility on both amide hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein structure and solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard state solubility free energies are accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The experimental trend of decreasing solubility as a function of n-alkylamide chain length is recapitulated by the increasing stability of the crystalline state and to a lesser degree by decreasing favorability of solvation (i.e., the hydrophobic effect). Our results suggest that coupling the polarizable AMOEBA force field with an orthogonal space based free energy algorithm, as implemented in the program Force Field X, is a consistent procedure for predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals.},

  abstract = {The solubility of organic molecules is of critical importance to the pharmaceutical industry; however, robust computational methods to predict this quantity from first-principles are lacking. Solubility can be computed from a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the sum of solid\textendash{}vapor sublimation and vapor\textendash{}liquid solvation free energies $\Delta$Gsolubility$^\circ$ = $\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ + $\Delta$Gsolv$^\circ$. Over the past few decades, alchemical simulation methods to compute solvation free energy using classical force fields have become widely used. However, analogous methods for determining the free energy of the sublimation/deposition phase transition are currently limited by the necessity of a priori knowledge of the atomic coordinates of the crystal. Here, we describe progress toward an alternative scheme based on growth of the asymmetric unit into a crystal via alchemy (GAUCHE). GAUCHE computes deposition free energy $\Delta$Gdep$^\circ$ = -$\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ = -kBT ln(Vc/Vg) + $\Delta$GAU + $\Delta$GAU$\rightarrow$UC as the sum of an entropic term to account for compressing a vapor at 1 M standard state (Vg) into the molar volume of the crystal (Vc), where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin, plus two simulation steps. In the first simulation step, the deposition free energy $\Delta$GAU for a system composed of only NAU asymmetric unit (AU) molecule(s) is computed beginning from an arbitrary conformation in vacuum. In the second simulation step, the change in free energy $\Delta$GAU$\rightarrow$UC to expand the asymmetric unit degrees of freedom into a unit cell (UC) composed of NUC independent molecules is computed. This latter step accounts for the favorable free energy of removing the constraint that every symmetry mate of the asymmetric unit has an identical conformation and intermolecular interactions. The current work is based on NVT simulations, which requires knowledge of the crystal space group and unit cell parameters from experiment, but not a priori knowledge of crystalline atomic coordinates. GAUCHE was applied to 5 organic molecules whose sublimation free energy has been measured experimentally, based on the polarizable AMOEBA force field and more than a microsecond of sampling per compound in the program Force Field X. The mean unsigned and RMS errors were only 1.6 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicates that GAUCHE is capable of accurate prediction of absolute sublimation thermodynamics.},

In the present study we have assessed the average accuracy of free energy calculations for a total of 92 ligands binding to five different targets. To make this study and future larger scale applications possible we automated the setup procedure. Starting from user defined binding modes, the procedure decides which ligands to connect via a perturbation based on maximum common substructure criteria and produces all necessary parameter files for free energy calculations in AMBER 11. For the systems investigated, errors due to insufficient sampling were found to be substantial in some cases whereas differences in estimators (thermodynamic integration (TI) versus multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)) were found to be negligible. Analytical uncertainty estimates calculated from a single free energy calculation were found to be much smaller than the sample standard deviation obtained from two independent free energy calculations. Agreement with experiment was found to be system dependent ranging from excellent to mediocre (RMSE = [0.9, 8.2, 4.7, 5.7, 8.7] kJ/mol). When restricting analyses to free energy calculations with sample standard deviations below 1 kJ/mol agreement with experiment improved (RMSE = [0.8, 6.9, 1.8, 3.9, 5.6] kJ/mol).},

This challenge is rooted to a large extent in the considerable changes in conformational, translational, and rotational entropies underlying the binding process that atomistic simulations cannot easily sample. In spite of significant methodological advances, reflected in a continuously improving agreement with experiment, a characterization of alternate strategies aimed at measuring binding affinities, notably their respective advantages and drawbacks, is somewhat lacking. Here, two distinct avenues to determine the standard binding free energy are compared in the case of a short, proline-rich peptide associating to the Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinase Abl. These avenues, one relying upon alchemical transformations and the other on potentials of mean force (PMFs), invoke a series of geometrical restraints acting on collective variables designed to alleviate sampling limitations inherent to classical molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental binding free energy of $\Delta$Gbind = -7.99 kcal/mol is well reproduced by the two strategies developed herein, with $\Delta$Gbind = -7.7 for the alchemical route and $\Delta$Gbind = -7.8 kcal/mol for the alternate PMF-based route. In detailing the underpinnings of these numerical strategies devised for the accurate determination of standard binding free energies, many practical elements of the proposed rigorous, conceptual framework are clarified, thereby paving way to tackle virtually any recognition and association phenomenon.},

  abstract = {The emergence of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations is the major problem against AIDS treatment. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and free energy (MM\textendash{}PBSA and thermodynamic integration) analyses on wild-type (WT) and mutated HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) complexes with darunavir, amprenavir, indinavir, and saquinavir to clarify the mechanism of resistance due to the I50V flap mutation. Conformational analysis showed that the protease flaps are increasingly flexible in the I50V complexes. In the WT, stabilization of the HIV-1 PR structure is achieved via interflap and water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions between the flaps. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds between drugs and binding cavity residues (Asp29/29${'}$/30/30${'}$) are crucial for effective inhibition. All these interactions were significantly diminished (or absent) in the mutated forms, thus denoting their importance toward binding. Thermodynamic integration calculations reproduced the experimental data to within $\approx$1 kcal mol\textendash{}1 and showed that the I50V mutation results in weaker binding free energies for all analyzed complexes with respect to the WT. It was observed that the loss in binding energy upon mutation was mostly enthalpically driven in all complexes, with the greatest effect coming from the reduction of van der Waals interactions. Our results motivated us to test two novel compounds that have been synthesized to maximize interactions with HIV-1 PR. MM\textendash{}PBSA and TI calculations showed that compound 3c (Ghosh et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 22, 2308) is a promising protease inhibitor, which presents very effective binding to the WT PR ($\Delta$GMM\textendash{}PBSA = -17.2 kcal mol\textendash{}1, $\Delta$Gexp = -16.1 kcal mol\textendash{}1). Upon I50V mutation, the complex binding free energy was weakened by a $\Delta\Delta$GTI of 1.8 kcal mol\textendash{}1, comparable to the marketed inhibitors. This predicts that I50V may confer low resistance to 3c. This computational comparative study contributes toward elucidation of the I50V drug-resistance mechanism in HIV-1 PR.},

  abstract = {Author Summary  The capacity of the influenza virus to rapidly mutate and render resistance to a handful of FDA approved neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors represents a significant human health concern. To gain an atomic-level understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance, we applied a novel computational approach to characterize resistant NA mutations. These results are comparable in accuracy and precision with the best experimental measurements presently available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a rigorous computational method has attained the level of certainty needed to predict subtle changes in binding free energies conferred by mutations. Analysis of our simulation data provided a thorough description of the thermodynamics of the binding process for different NA-inhibitor complexes, with findings that in some cases challenge current views based on interpretations of the crystallographic data. While we did not find a generalized mechanism of NA resistance, we identified key differences between oseltamivir and zanamivir that discriminate their responses to the three mutations we considered, namely H274Y, N294S and Y252H. It is worth noting that our approach can be broadly applied to predict resistant mutations to existing and newly developed drugs in other important drug targets.},

The synthesis of a water-soluble, deep cavitand is described. The route comprises six (linear) steps from commercially available precursors, and it relies on the fourfold oligomeric cyclization reaction of resorcinol with 2,3-dihydrofuran that leads to the formation of a shallow resorcinarene framework; condensation with aromatic panels, which deepens the hydrophobic binding cavity; construction of rigid urea functionalities on the upper rim; and the introduction of the water-solubilizing methylimidazolium groups on the lower rim. Late intermediates of the synthesis can be used in the preparation of congener cavitands with different properties and applications, and a sample of such a synthetic procedure is included in this protocol. Emphasis is placed on scaled-up reactions and on purification procedures that afford materials in high yield and avoid chromatographic purification. This protocol provides improvements over previously described procedures, and it enables the preparation of sizable amounts of deep cavitands: 7 g of a water-soluble cavitand can be prepared from resorcinol in 13 working days.

  abstract = {Molecular docking programs screen chemical databases for novel ligands that fit protein binding sites. When one compound fits the site well, close analogs typically do the same. Therefore, many of the compounds that are found in such screens resemble one another. This reduces the variety and novelty of the compounds suggested. In an attempt to increase the diversity of docking hit lists, the Available Chemicals Directory was grouped into families of related structures. All members of every family were docked and scored, but only the best scoring molecule of a high-ranking family was allowed in the hit list. The identity and scores of the other members of these families were recorded as annotations to the best family member, but they were not independently ranked. This family-based docking method was compared with molecule-by-molecule docking in screens against the structures of thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and the cavity site of the mutant T4 lysozyme Leu99 $\rightarrow$ Ala (L99A). In each case, the diversity of the hit list increased, and more families of known ligands were found. To investigate whether the newly identified hits were sensible, we tested representative examples experimentally for binding to L99A and DHFR. Of the six compounds tested against L99A, five bound to the internal cavity. Of the seven compounds tested against DHFR, six inhibited the enzyme with apparent Ki values between 0.26 and 100 $\mu$M. The segregation of potential ligands into families of related molecules is a simple technique to increase the diversity of candidates suggested by database screens. The general approach should be applicable to most docking methods. Proteins 2001;42:279\textendash{}293. \textcopyright{} 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Sampling receptor flexibility is challenging for database docking. We consider a method that treats multiple flexible regions of the binding site independently, recombining them to generate different discrete conformations. This algorithm scales linearly rather than exponentially with the receptor's degrees of freedom. The method was first evaluated for its ability to identify known ligands of a hydrophobic cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme (L99A). Some 200,000 molecules of the Available Chemical Directory (ACD) were docked against an ensemble of cavity conformations. Surprisingly, the enrichment of known ligands from among a much larger number of decoys in the ACD was worse than simply docking to the apo conformation alone. Large decoys, accommodated in the larger cavity conformations sampled in the ensemble, were ranked better than known small ligands. The calculation was redone with an energy correction term that considered the cost of forming the larger cavity conformations. Enrichment improved, as did the balance between high-ranking large and small ligands. In a second retrospective test, the ACD was docked against a conformational ensemble of thymidylate synthase. Compared to docking against individual enzyme conformations, the flexible receptor docking approach improved enrichment of known ligands. Including a receptor conformational energy weighting term improved enrichment further. To test the method prospectively, the ACD database was docked against another cavity mutant of lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). A total of 18 new compounds predicted to bind this polar cavity and to change its conformation were tested experimentally; 14 were found to bind. The bound structures for seven ligands were determined by X-ray crystallography. The predicted geometries of these ligands all corresponded to the observed geometries to within 0.7 {\AA} RMSD or better. Significant conformational changes of the cavity were observed in all seven complexes. In five structures, part of the observed accommodations were correctly predicted; in two structures, the receptor conformational changes were unanticipated and thus never sampled. These results suggest that although sampling receptor flexibility can lead to novel ligands that would have been missed when docking a rigid structure, it is also important to consider receptor conformational energy.},

Application of $\lambda$-dynamics to this system gives a reasonable estimate of the binding affinity of the ligands. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional MD. This is due to the scaling of forces inherent in the $\lambda$-dynamics method, which lowers the barriers separating different binding modes and conformations. Examination of the $\lambda$-dynamics trajectory of the ligands revealed alternative binding orientations and conformations not detected by crystallography. Furthermore, a $\lambda$-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure, successfully samples the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands. Ligand sampling by conventional MD starting from same initial structures remains trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such efficient sampling of ligand orientations and conformations is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to yield a reasonable estimate of the binding free energy.},

Application of $\lambda$ dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the method to these cases, a new restraining potential was devised and added to the extended Hamiltonian. Two approximations were introduced in order to estimate the binding free energy within small simulation times using this potential: (a) The entropy terms related to the restraining potential are assumed to cancel, due to the similarity of the ligands. (b) The restraining potential calculated from the coordinates of the environmental atoms during a $\lambda$-dynamics simulation is assumed to be equal to that of the average coordinates. Relatively short $\lambda$-dynamics simulations with this restraining potential successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of the ligands as compared with both experimental data and free energy perturbation calculations. Long time $\lambda$-dynamics simulations with a ten-ligand system revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. Furthermore, short time $\lambda$-dynamics simulations with ten identical ligands demonstrated that sufficient precision was achieved for putative discovery of tight binding ligands or guests.},

  abstract = {A previously proposed electron transfer (ET) pathway in the heme enzyme cytochrome c peroxidase has been excised from the structure, leaving an open ligand-binding channel in its place. Earlier studies on cavity mutants of this enzyme have revealed structural plasticity in this region of the molecule. Analysis of these structures has allowed the design of a variant in which the specific section of protein backbone representing a previously proposed ET pathway is accurately extracted from the protein. A crystal structure verified the creation of an open channel that overlays the removed segment, extending from the surface of the protein to the heme at the core of the protein. A number of heterocyclic cations were found to bind to the proximal-channel mutant with affinities that can be rationalized based on the structures. It is proposed that small ligands bind more weakly to the proximal-channel mutant than to the W191G cavity due to an increased off rate of the open channel, whereas larger ligands are able to bind to the channel mutant without inducing large conformational changes. The structure of benzimidazole bound to the proximal-channel mutant shows that the ligand accurately overlays the position of the tryptophan radical center that was removed from the wild-type enzyme and displaces four of the eight ordered solvent molecules seen in the empty cavity. Ligand binding also caused a small rearrangement of the redesigned protein loop, perhaps as a result of improved electrostatic interactions with the ligand. The engineered channel offers the potential for introducing synthetic replacements for the removed structure, such as sensitizer-linked substrates. These installed ``molecular wires'' could be used to rapidly initiate reactions, trap reactive intermediates, or answer unresolved questions about ET pathways.},

  abstract = {Cavity complementation has been observed in many proteins, where an appropriate small molecule binds to a cavity-forming mutant. Here, the binding of compounds to the W191G cavity mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase is characterized by X-ray crystallography and binding thermodynamics. Unlike cavities created by removal of hydrophobic side-chains, the W191G cavity does not bind neutral or hydrophobic compounds, but displays a strong specificity for heterocyclic cations, consistent with the role of the protein to stabilize a tryptophan radical at this site. Ligand dissociation constants for the protonated cationic state ranged from 6 $\mu$M for 2-amino-5-methylthiazole to 1 mM for neutral ligands, and binding was associated with a large enthalpy-entropy compensation. X-ray structures show that each of 18 compounds with binding behavior bind specifically within the artificial cavity and not elsewhere in the protein. The compounds make multiple hydrogen bonds to the cavity walls using a subset of the interactions seen between the protein and solvent in the absence of ligand. For all ligands, every atom that is capable of making a hydrogen bond does so with either protein or solvent. The most often seen interaction is to Asp235, and most compounds bind with a specific orientation that is defined by their ability to interact with this residue. Four of the ligands do not have conventional hydrogen bonding atoms, but were nevertheless observed to orient their most polar CH bond towards Asp235. Two of the larger ligands induce disorder in a surface loop between Pro190 and Asn195 that has been identified as a mobile gate to cavity access. Despite the predominance of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, the small variation in observed binding free energies were not correlated readily with the strength, type or number of hydrogen bonds or with calculated electrostatic energies alone. Thus, as with naturally occurring binding sites, affinities to W191G are likely to be due to a subtle balance of polar, non-polar, and solvation terms. These studies demonstrate how cavity complementation and judicious choice of site can be used to produce a protein template with an unusual ligand-binding specificity.},

However, only four of the proteins gave acceptable errors, correlations, and rankings. The results could be improved by using nine intermediate states in the simulations or including the entire protein in the simulations using periodic boundary conditions. However, 27 of the calculated affinities still gave errors of more than 4 kJ/mol, and for three of the proteins the results were not satisfactory. This shows that the performance of BAR calculations depends on the target protein and that several transformations gave poor results owing to limitations in the molecular-mechanics force field or the restricted sampling possible within a reasonable simulation time. Still, the BAR results are better than docking calculations for most of the proteins.},

However, the performance of existing computationally demanding binding free energy calculation methods in this context is largely unknown.

The data sets pose challenges typical for this early stage of drug discovery. None of the methods was sufficiently predictive when applied out of the box without considering these challenges. Detailed investigations of failures revealed critical points that are essential for good binding free energy predictions. When data set-specific features were considered accordingly, predictions valuable for lead optimization could be obtained for all approaches but LIE. Our findings lead to clear recommendations for when to use which of the above approaches. Our findings also stress the important role of expert knowledge in this process, not least for estimating the accuracy of prediction results by TI, using indicators such as the size and chemical structure of exchanged groups and the statistical error in the predictions. Such knowledge will be invaluable when it comes to the question which of the TI results can be trusted for decision making.},

  abstract = {Additivity of functional group contributions to protein\textendash{}ligand binding is a very popular concept in medicinal chemistry as the basis of rational design and optimized lead structures. Most of the currently applied scoring functions for docking build on such additivity models. Even though the limitation of this concept is well known, case studies examining in detail why additivity fails at the molecular level are still very scarce. The present study shows, by use of crystal structure analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry for a congeneric series of thrombin inhibitors, that extensive cooperative effects between hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bond formation are intimately coupled via dynamic properties of the formed complexes. The formation of optimal lipophilic contacts with the surface of the thrombin S3 pocket and the full desolvation of this pocket can conflict with the formation of an optimal hydrogen bond between ligand and protein. The mutual contributions of the competing interactions depend on the size of the ligand hydrophobic substituent and influence the residual mobility of ligand portions at the binding site. Analysis of the individual crystal structures and factorizing the free energy into enthalpy and entropy demonstrates that binding affinity of the ligands results from a mixture of enthalpic contributions from hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts, and entropic considerations involving an increasing loss of residual mobility of the bound ligands. This complex picture of mutually competing and partially compensating enthalpic and entropic effects determines the non-additivity of free energy contributions to ligand binding at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {The binding of a series of p-alkylbenzamidinium chloride inhibitors to the serine proteinase trypsin over a range of temperatures has been studied using isothermal titration (micro)calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The inhibitors have small structural variations at the para position of the benzamidinium ion. They show small differences in relative binding affinity but large compensating differences in enthalpy and entropy. Binding affinity decreases with increased branching at the first carbon but increases with increasing the length of a linear alkyl substituent, suggesting that steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions play dominant roles in binding. Structural analysis showed that the backbone of the enzyme was unaffected by the change of the para substituent. In addition, binding does not correlate strongly with octanol/water partition data. To further characterize this system, the change in the heat capacity on binding, the change in solvent-accessible surface area on binding, the effect of inhibitor binding on the hydration of the active site, the pKa of His57, and interactions within the catalytic triad have been investigated. Although the changes in inhibitor structure are small, it is demonstrated that simple concepts such as steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and buried surface area are insufficient to explain the binding data. Other factors, such as access to the binding site and the cost of dehydration of the active site, are of equal or greater importance.},

By projecting the electrostatic preorganization energy from the OSP simulations, an increase in efficiency of a factor 7.5 can even be achieved. Loss of accuracy with respect to the TI data is limited to 3.9 and 5.6 kJ/mol, respectively, making it an attractive approach for lead optimization programs in drug research.},

  abstract = {The binding of charged ligands benzamidine and diazamidine to trypsin was investigated by using a polarizable potential energy function and explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies were computed from the difference between the free energies of decoupling the ligand from water and protein environments. Both the absolute and the relative free energies from the perturbation simulations agree with experimental measurements to within 0.5 kcal$\cdot$mol-1. Comparison of free-energy components sampled from different thermodynamic paths indicates that electrostatics is the main driving force behind benzamidine recognition of trypsin. The contribution of electronic polarization to binding appears to be crucial. By computing the free-energy contribution caused by the polarization between the ligand and its surroundings, we found that polarization has the opposite effect in dissimilar environments. Although polarization favors ligand solvation in water, it weakens the protein\textendash{}ligand attraction by screening the electrostatic interaction between trypsin and benzamidine. We also examined the relative binding free energies of a benzamidine analog diazamidine to trypsin. The changes in free energy on benzamidine-diazamidine substitution were tens of kilocalories in both water and trypsin environments; however, the change in the total binding free energy is $<$2 kcal$\cdot$mol-1 because of cancellation, consistent with the experimental results. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a polarizable force field, given adequate sampling, is capable of achieving chemical accuracy in molecular simulations of protein\textendash{}ligand recognition.},

The inhibitors investigated were initially proposed as part of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Free Energy Evaluation (CATFEE) project for which no experimental results nor any assessment of the predictions submitted by various groups have ever been published. The inhibitors studied represent a severe challenge for explicit free energy calculations. The mutations from one compound to another involve up to 19 atoms, the creation and annihilation of net charge and several alternate binding modes. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain highly converged results ($\pm$ 5\textendash{}10 kJ/mol) even for such complex multi-atom mutations by simulating on a nanosecond time scale. This is achieved by using soft-core potentials to facilitate the creation and deletion of atoms and by a careful choice of mutation pathway. The results show that given modest computational resources, explicit free energy calculations can be successfully applied to realistic problems in drug design.},

  abstract = {We have calculated the binding free energies of a series of benzamidine-like inhibitors to trypsin with a polarizable force field using both explicit and implicit solvent approaches. Free energy perturbation has been performed for the ligands in bulk water and in protein complex with molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated from explicit solvent simulations are well within the accuracy of experimental measurement and the direction of change is predicted correctly in all cases. We analyzed the molecular dipole moments of the ligands in gas, water and protein environments. Neither binding affinity nor ligand solvation free energy in bulk water shows much dependence on the molecular dipole moments of the ligands. Substitution of the aromatic or the charged group in the ligand results in considerable change in the solvation energy in bulk water and protein whereas the binding affinity varies insignificantly due to cancellation. The effect of chemical modification on ligand charge distribution is mostly local. Replacing benzene with diazine has minimal impact on the atomic multipoles at the amidinium group. We have also utilized an implicit solvent based end-state approach to evaluate the binding free energies of these inhibitors. In this approach, the polarizable multipole model combined with Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PMPB/SA) provides the electrostatic interaction energy and the polar solvation free energy. Overall the relative binding free energies obtained from the MM-PMPB/SA model are in good agreement with the experimental data. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2009},

The computational protocol leveraged docking and high level atomistic models to improve enrichment. The enrichment factor of our blind predictions ranked best among all of the computational submissions, and second best overall. This work represents to our knowledge the first example of the application of an all-atom physics-based binding free energy model to large scale virtual screening. A total of 285 parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics absolute protein-ligand binding free energy simulations were conducted starting from docked poses. The setup of the simulations was fully automated, calculations were distributed on multiple computing resources and were completed in a 6-weeks period. The accuracy of the docked poses and the inclusion of intramolecular strain and entropic losses in the binding free energy estimates were the major factors behind the success of the method. Lack of sufficient time and computing resources to investigate additional protonation states of the ligands was a major cause of mispredictions. The experiment demonstrated the applicability of binding free energy modeling to improve hit rates in challenging virtual screening of focused ligand libraries during lead optimization.},

The approach makes use of a physical pathway, eliminating the need for complicated alchemical decoupling schemes. We compare our nonequilibrium results to those obtained via a fully equilibrium approach and to experiment. The results of this study suggest that to obtain accurate results using nonequilibrium approaches one should use the stiff-spring approximation with the second cumulant expansion. From this study we conclude that nonequilibrium simulation could provide a simple means to estimate protein-ligand binding affinities.},

Using the latest version of the general assisted model building with energy refinement (AMBER) force field for ligand model parameters and the Bennett acceptance ratio for computing free-energy differences, we obtained an excellent linear fit between the calculated and experimental binding free energies. The rms error from a linear fit is 0.4 kcal $\slash$ mol for eight ligand complexes. In comparison with a previous study of the binding energies of these same eight ligand complexes, these results suggest that the use of improved model parameters can lead to more predictive binding estimates, and that these estimates can be obtained with significantly less computer time than previously thought. These findings make such direct methods more attractive for use in rational drug design.},

With the unified force field parametrization we performed massively parallel computations of absolute binding free energies for pharmaceutical target proteins and ligands. Compared with the previous calculation with the ff99 force field in the Amber simulation package (Amber99) and the ligand charges produced by the Austin Model 1 bond charge correction (AM1-BCC), the unified parametrization gave better absolute binding energies for the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) and ligand system. Our method is based on extensive work measurement between thermodynamic states to calculate the free energy difference and it is also the same as the traditional free energy perturbation. There are important requirements for accurate calculations. The first is a well-equilibrated bound structure including the conformational change of the protein induced by the binding of the ligand. The second requirement is the convergence of the work distribution with a sufficient number of trajectories and dense spacing of the coupling constant between the ligand and the rest of the system. Finally, the most important requirement is the force field parametrization.},

  abstract = {The absolute (standard) binding free energy of eight FK506-related ligands to FKBP12 is calculated using free energy perturbation molecular dynamics (FEP/MD) simulations with explicit solvent. A number of features are implemented to improve the accuracy and enhance the convergence of the calculations. First, the absolute binding free energy is decomposed into sequential steps during which the ligand-surrounding interactions as well as various biasing potentials restraining the translation, orientation, and conformation of the ligand are turned ``on'' and ``off.'' Second, sampling of the ligand conformation is enforced by a restraining potential based on the root mean-square deviation relative to the bound state conformation. The effect of all the restraining potentials is rigorously unbiased, and it is shown explicitly that the final results are independent of all artificial restraints. Third, the repulsive and dispersive free energy contribution arising from the Lennard-Jones interactions of the ligand with its surrounding (protein and solvent) is calculated using the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen separation. This separation also improves convergence of the FEP/MD calculations. Fourth, to decrease the computational cost, only a small number of atoms in the vicinity of the binding site are simulated explicitly, while all the influence of the remaining atoms is incorporated implicitly using the generalized solvent boundary potential (GSBP) method. With GSBP, the size of the simulated FKBP12/ligand systems is significantly reduced, from $\sim$25,000 to 2500. The computations are very efficient and the statistical error is small ($\sim$1 kcal/mol). The calculated binding free energies are generally in good agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations (within $\sim$2 kcal/mol). The present results indicate that a strategy based on FEP/MD simulations of a reduced GSBP atomic model sampled with conformational, translational, and orientational restraining potentials can be computationally inexpensive and accurate.},

The results of this approach agree well with experimentally observed binding affinities. Also assessed is a commonly used approximate endpoint approach, which separately estimates enthalpy, solvation free energy, and entropy. We show that this endpoint approach has numerous variations, all of which are prone to critical shortcomings.

The sialidase inhibitory activities of these compounds correlate well with their in vitro antiviral efficacy, and several of the most potent analogues displayed useful antiviral activity in vivo when evaluated in a mouse model of influenza A virus infection.

The methodology is tested by calculation of the relative binding free energies of a set of inhibitors of neuraminidase, cyclooxygenase2, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The calculated free energies are compared to the results obtained with explicit solvent simulations and empirical scoring functions. For cyclooxygenase2, deficiencies in the continuum electrostatics theory are identified and corrected with a modified simulation protocol. For neuraminidase, it is shown that a continuum representation of the solvent leads to markedly different protein-ligand interactions compared to the explicit solvent simulations, and a reconciliation of the two protocols is problematic. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 proves more challenging, and none of the methods employed in this study yield high quality predictions. Despite the differences observed, for these systems, the use of an implicit solvent framework to predict the ranking of congeneric inhibitors to a protein is shown to be faster, as accurate or more accurate than the explicit solvent protocol, and superior to empirical scoring schemes.},

This study details structural and in vitro analyses of a class of inhibitors that bind uniquely in both subsites. Crystal structures of three inhibitors show occupation of the 150-cavity in two distinct and novel binding modes. We believe these are the first nanomolar inhibitors of NA to be characterized in this way. Furthermore, we show that one inhibitor, binding within the catalytic site, offers reduced susceptibility to known resistance mutations via increased flexibility of a pendant pentyloxy group and the ability to pivot about a strong hydrogen-bonding network.},

Here, we perform free-energy calculations for three different ligands binding to OppA, using a thermodynamic integration approach. The tripeptide ligands share a high structural similarity (all have the sequence KXK), but their experimentally-determined binding free energies differ remarkably. Thermodynamic cycles were constructed for the ligands, and simulations conducted in the bound and (freely solvated) unbound states. In the unbound state, it was observed that the difference in conformational freedom between alanine and glycine leads to a surprisingly slow convergence, despite their chemical similarity. This could be overcome by increasing the softness parameter during alchemical transformations. Discrepancies remained in the bound state however, when comparing independent simulations of the three ligands. These difficulties could be traced to a slow relaxation of the water network within the active site. Fluctuations in the number of water molecules residing in the binding cavity occur mostly on a timescale larger than the simulation time along the alchemical path. After extensive simulations, relative binding free energies that were converged to within thermal noise could be obtained, which agree well with available experimental data.},

It is therefore an ideal system for studying how different chemical groups can be accommodated in a protein interior. The ability of the protein to bind peptides of different lengths has been studied by co-crystallising it with different ligands.

Results Crystals of OppA from Salmonella typhimurium complexed with the peptides Lys\textendash{}Lys\textendash{}Lys (KKK) and Lys\textendash{}Lys\textendash{}Lys\textendash{}Ala (KKKA) have been grown in the presence of uranyl ions which form important crystal contacts. These structures have been refined to 1.4 {\aa} and 2.1 {\aa}, respectively. The ligands are completely enclosed, their side chains pointing into large hydrated cavities and making few strong interactions with the protein.

Conclusion Tight peptide binding by OppA arises from strong hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the protein and the main chain of the ligand. Different basic side chains on the protein form salt bridges with the C terminus of peptide ligands of different lengths.},

The tripeptides fall into three series of ligands, which have been designed to examine the effects of small changes to the central side chain. Three ligands have a primary amine as the second side chain, two have a straight alkane chain, and three have ring systems. The results have revealed a definite preference for the binding of hydrophobic residues over the positively charged side chains, the latter binding only weakly due to unfavorable enthalpic effects. Within the series of positively charged groups, a point of lowest affinity has been identified and this is proposed to arise from unfavorable electrostatic interactions in the pocket, including the disruption of a key salt bridge. Marked entropy-enthalpy compensation is found across the series, and some of the difficulties in designing tightly binding ligands have been highlighted.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in improved force fields and sampling methods have made it possible for the accurate calculation of protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies. Alchemical free energy perturbation (FEP) using an explicit solvent model is one of the most rigorous methods to calculate relative binding free energies. However, for cases where there are high energy barriers separating the relevant conformations that are important for ligand binding, the calculated free energy may depend on the initial conformation used in the simulation due to the lack of complete sampling of all the important regions in phase space. This is particularly true for ligands with multiple possible binding modes separated by high energy barriers, making it difficult to sample all relevant binding modes even with modern enhanced sampling methods. In this paper, we apply a previously developed method that provides a corrected binding free energy for ligands with multiple binding modes by combining the free energy results from multiple alchemical FEP calculations starting from all enumerated poses, and the results are compared with Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations. From these calculations, the dominant ligand binding mode can also be predicted. We apply this method to a series of ligands that bind to c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and obtain improved free energy results. The dominant ligand binding modes predicted by this method agree with the available crystallography, while both Glide docking and MM-GBSA calculations incorrectly predict the binding modes for some ligands. The method also helps separate the force field error from the ligand sampling error, such that deviations in the predicted binding free energy from the experimental values likely indicate possible inaccuracies in the force field. An error in the force field for a subset of the ligands studied was identified using this method, and improved free energy results were obtained by correcting the partial charges assigned to the ligands. This improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the predicted binding free energy from 1.9 kcal/mol with the original partial charges to 1.3 kcal/mol with the corrected partial charges.},

We applied molecular dynamics simulations to study the forces and mechanical stresses associated with forced dissociation of aqueous cucurbituril\textendash{}guest complexes with high binding affinities. First, the unbinding transitions were modeled with constant velocity pulling (steered dynamics) and a soft spring constant, to model atomic force microscopy experiments. The computed length\textendash{}force profiles yield rupture forces in good agreement with available measurements. We also used steered dynamics with high spring constants to generate paths characterized by a tight control over the specified pulling distance; these paths were then equilibrated via umbrella sampling simulations and used to compute time-averaged mechanical stresses along the dissociation pathways. The stress calculations proved to be informative regarding the key interactions determining the length\textendash{}force profiles and rupture forces. In particular, the unbinding transition of one complex is found to be a stepwise process, which is initially dominated by electrostatic interactions between the guest's ammoniums and the host's carbonyl groups and subsequently limited by the extraction of the guest's bulky bicyclooctane moiety; the latter step requires some bond stretching at the cucurbituril's extraction portal. Conversely, the dissociation of a second complex with a more slender guest is mainly driven by successive electrostatic interactions between the different guest's ammoniums and the host's carbonyl groups. The calculations also provide information on the origins of thermodynamic irreversibilities in these forced dissociation processes.},

  abstract = {This article addresses calculations of the standard free energy of binding from molecular simulations in which a bound ligand is extracted from its binding site by steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or equilibrium umbrella sampling (US). Host\textendash{}guest systems are used as test beds to examine the requirements for obtaining the reversible work of ligand extraction. We find that, for both steered MD and US, marked irreversibilities can occur when the guest molecule crosses an energy barrier and suddenly jumps to a new position, causing dissipation of energy stored in the stretched molecule(s). For flexible molecules, this occurs even when a stiff pulling spring is used, and it is difficult to suppress in calculations where the spring is attached to the molecules by single, fixed attachment points. We, therefore, introduce and test a method, fluctuation-guided pulling, which adaptively adjusts the spring's attachment points based on the guest's atomic fluctuations relative to the host. This adaptive approach is found to substantially improve the reversibility of both steered MD and US calculations for the present systems. The results are then used to estimate standard binding free energies within a comprehensive framework, termed attach-pull-release, which recognizes that the standard free energy of binding must include not only the pulling work itself, but also the work of attaching and then releasing the spring, where the release work includes an accounting of the standard concentration to which the ligand is discharged. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This has contributed to uncertainty and controversy in certain areas. This article therefore reviews and extends the connections of some important computational methods with the underlying statistical thermodynamics. A derivation of the standard free energy of binding forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding affinities. It also permits several important points to be established. For example, it is found that the double-annihilation method of computing binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding, but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of solvent molecules explicitly.},

  abstract = {Advanced potential energy surfaces are defined as theoretical models that explicitly include many-body effects that transcend the standard fixed-charge, pairwise-additive paradigm typically used in molecular simulation. However, several factors relating to their software implementation have precluded their widespread use in condensed-phase simulations: the computational cost of the theoretical models, a paucity of approximate models and algorithmic improvements that can ameliorate their cost, under-developed interfaces and limited dissemination in computational code bases that are widely used in the computational chemistry community, and software implementations that have not kept pace with modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures, such as multicore CPUs and modern graphics processing units (GPUs). In this Feature article we review recent progress made in these areas, including well-defined polarization approximations and new multipole electrostatic formulations, novel methods for solving the mutual polarization equations and increasing the MD time step, combining linear scaling electronic structure methods with new QM/MM methods that account for mutual polarization between the two regions, and the greatly improved software deployment of these models and methods onto GPU and CPU hardware platforms. We have now approached an era where multipole-based polarizable force fields can be routinely used to obtain computational results comparable to state-of-the-art density functional theory while reaching sampling statistics that are acceptable when compared to that obtained from simpler fixed partial charge force fields.},

  abstract = {Methods to compute free energy differences between different states of a molecular system are reviewed with the aim of identifying their basic ingredients and their utility when applied in practice to biomolecular systems. A free energy calculation is comprised of three basic components: (i) a suitable model or Hamiltonian, (ii) a sampling protocol with which one can generate a representative ensemble of molecular configurations, and (iii) an estimator of the free energy difference itself. Alternative sampling protocols can be distinguished according to whether one or more states are to be sampled. In cases where only a single state is considered, six alternative techniques could be distinguished: (i) changing the dynamics, (ii) deforming the energy surface, (iii) extending the dimensionality, (iv) perturbing the forces, (v) reducing the number of degrees of freedom, and (vi) multi-copy approaches. In cases where multiple states are to be sampled, the three primary techniques are staging, importance sampling, and adiabatic decoupling. Estimators of the free energy can be classified as global methods that either count the number of times a given state is sampled or use energy differences. Or, they can be classified as local methods that either make use of the force or are based on transition probabilities. Finally, this overview of the available techniques and how they can be best used in a practical context is aimed at helping the reader choose the most appropriate combination of approaches for the biomolecular system, Hamiltonian and free energy difference of interest. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Traditional free energy calculation methods are well-known for their drawbacks in scalability and speed in converging results particularly for calculations with large perturbations. In the present work, we report on the development of biasing potential replica exchange multisite $\lambda$-dynamics (BP-REX MS$\lambda$D), which is a free energy method that is capable of performing simultaneous alchemical free energy transformations, including perturbations between flexible moieties. BP-REX MS$\lambda$D and the original MS$\lambda$D are applied to a series of symmetrical 2,5-benzoquinone derivatives covering a diverse chemical space and range of conformational flexibility. Improved $\lambda$-space sampling is observed for the BP-REX MS$\lambda$D simulations, yielding a 2\textendash{}5-fold increase in the number of transitions between substituents compared to traditional MS$\lambda$D. We also demonstrate the efficacy of varying the value of c, the parameter that controls the ruggedness of the landscape mediating the sampling of $\lambda$-states, based on the flexibility of the fragment. Finally, we developed a protocol for maximizing the transition frequency between fragments. This protocol reduces the ``kinetic barrier'' for alchemically transforming fragments by grouping and ordering based on volume. These findings are applied to a challenging test set involving a series of geldanamycin-based inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Even though the perturbations span volume changes by as large as 60 {\AA}3, the values for the free energy change achieve an average unsigned error (AUE) of 1.5 kcal/mol relative to experimental Kd measurements with a reasonable correlation (R = 0.56). Our results suggest that the BP-REX MS$\lambda$D algorithm is a highly efficient and scalable free energy method, which when utilized will enable routine calculations on the order of hundreds of compounds using only a few simulations.},

This sampling issue is particularly severe when the collective variable is defined in a low-dimension subset of the target system; then the ``Hamiltonian lagging'' problem, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the move of the collective variable, may be likely to occur. To overcome this problem in equilibrium conformational sampling, we adopted the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) strategy, which was originally developed in the context of free energy simulation [L. Zheng, M. Chen, and W. Yang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.105, 20227 (2008)]. Thereby, generalized ensemble simulations can simultaneously escape both the explicit barriers along the collective variable direction and the hidden barriers that are strongly coupled with the collective variable move. As demonstrated in our model studies, the present OSRW based generalized ensemble treatments show improved sampling capability over the corresponding classical generalized ensemble treatments.},

  abstract = {A general methodology for calculating the equilibrium binding constant of a flexible ligand to a protein receptor is formulated on the basis of potentials of mean force. The overall process is decomposed into several stages that can be computed separately: the free ligand in the bulk is first restrained into the conformation it adopts in the bound state, position, and orientation by applying biasing potentials, then it is translated into the binding site, where it is released completely. The conformational restraining potential is based on the root-mean-square deviation of the peptide coordinates relative to its average conformation in the bound complex. Free energy contributions from each stage are calculated by means of free energy perturbation potential of mean force techniques by using appropriate order parameters. The present approach avoids the need to decouple the ligand from its surrounding (bulk solvent and receptor protein) as is traditionally performed in the double-decoupling scheme. It is believed that the present formulation will be particularly useful when the solvation free energy of the ligand is very large. As an application, the equilibrium binding constant of the phosphotyrosine peptide pYEEI to the Src homology 2 domain of human Lck has been calculated. The results are in good agreement with experimental values.},

  abstract = {The calculation of protein\textendash{}ligand binding free energies is an important goal in the field of computational chemistry. Applying path-sampling methods for this purpose involves calculating the associated potential of mean force (PMF) and gives insight into the binding free energy along the binding process. Without a priori knowledge about the binding path, sampling reversible binding can be difficult to achieve. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the distancefield (DF) as a reaction coordinate for such calculations. DF is a grid-based method in which the shortest distance between the binding site and a ligand is determined avoiding routes that pass through the protein. Combining this reaction coordinate with Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (HREMD) allows for the reversible binding of the ligand to the protein. A comparison is made between umbrella sampling using regular distance restraints and HREMD with DF restraints to study aspirin binding to the protein phospholipase A2. Although the free energies of binding are similar for both methods, the increased sampling with HREMD has a significant influence on the shape of the PMF. A remarkable agreement between the calculated binding free energies from the PMF and the experimental estimate is obtained.},

@article{calabro_accelerating_2015,
  title = {Accelerating Molecular Simulations Implication for Rational Drug Design},
  abstract = {The development and approval of new drugs is an expensive process. The total
cost for the approval of a new compound is on average 1.0 - 1.2 billion dollars and
the entire process lasts about 12 - 15 years. The main difficulties are related to
poor pharmacokinetics, lack of efficacy and unwanted side effects. These problems
have naturally led to the question if new and alternative methodologies can be
developed to find reliable and low cost alternatives to existing practices.
Nowadays, computer-assisted tools are used to support the decision process
along the early stages of the drug discovery path leading from the identification
of a suitable biomolecular target to the design/optimization of drug-like
molecules. This process includes assessments about target druggability, screening
of molecular libraries and the optimization of lead compounds where new drug-like
molecules able to bind with sufficiently affinity and specificity to a disease-involved
protein are designed. Existing computational methods used by the pharmaceutical
industry are usually focused on the screening of library compounds such as
docking, chemoinformatics and other ligand-based methods to predict and improve
binding affinities, but their reliable application requires improvements in
accuracy.
New quantitative methods based on molecular simulations of drug binding
to a protein could greatly improve prospects for the reliable in-silico design of
new potent drug candidates. A common parameter used by medicinal chemists to
quantify the affinity between candidate ligands and a target protein is represented
by the free energy of binding. However, despite the increased amount of structural
information, predicting binding free energy is still a challenge and this technique
has found limited use beyond academia. A major reason for limited adoption in
the industry is that reliable computer models of drug binding to a protein must
reproduce the change in molecular conformations of the drug and protein upon
complex formation and this includes the correct modelling of weak non-covalent
interactions such as hydrogen bonds, burials of hydrophobic surface areas, Van der
Waals interactions, fixations of molecular degrees of freedom solvation/desolvation
of polar groups and different entropy contributions related to the solvent and
protein interactions. For several classes of proteins these phenomena are not easy
to model and often require extremely computationally intensive simulations.
The main goal of the thesis was to explore efficient ways of computing binding
affinities by using molecular simulations. With this aim, novel software to compute
relative binding free energies has been developed. The implementation is based on
alchemical transformations and it extended a preexisted piece of software Sire, a
molecular modeling framework, by using the OpenMM APIs to run fast molecular
dynamics simulations on the latest GPGPU technology. This new piece of software
has equipped the scientific community with a flexible and fast tool, not only
to predict relative binding affinities, but also a starting point to develop new
sampling methods for instance hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo. The
implementation has been validated on the prediction of relative hydration free
energy of small molecules, showing good agreement with experimental data. In
addition, non-additive effects to binding affinities in series of congeneric Thrombin
inhibitors were investigated. Although excellent agreement between predicted
and experimental relative binding affinities was achieved, it was not possible to
accurately predict the non-additivity levels in most of the examined inhibitors,
thus suggesting that improved force fields are required to further advance the
state-of-the art of the field.},

Non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase are an important component of treatment against HIV infection. Novel inhibitors are sought that increase potency against variants that contain the Tyr181Cys mutation.
Methods
Molecular dynamics based free energy perturbation simulations have been run to study factors that contribute to protein\textendash{}ligand binding, and the results are compared with those from previous Monte Carlo based simulations and activity data.
Results
Predictions of protein\textendash{}ligand binding modes are very consistent for the two simulation methods; the accord is attributed to the use of an enhanced sampling protocol. The Tyr181Cys binding pocket supports large, hydrophobic substituents, which is in good agreement with experiment.
Conclusions
Although some discrepancies exist between the results of the two simulation methods and experiment, free energy perturbation simulations can be used to rapidly test small molecules for gains in binding affinity.
General significance
Free energy perturbation methods show promise in providing fast, reliable and accurate data that can be used to complement experiment in lead optimization projects. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ``Recent developments of molecular dynamics''.},

Predictions obtained from the simulations with an explicit solvation model are in good qualitative agreement with experimental data, while simulations with implicit solvent models or rank ordering by empirical scoring functions yield predictions of lower quality. In addition, it is shown that free energy techniques can be used to select the most likely binding mode from a set of possible orientations generated by a docking program.

  abstract = {Computational chemists use structure-based drug design and molecular dynamics of drug/protein complexes which require an accurate description of the conformational space of drugs. Organic chemists use qualitative chemical principles such as the effect of electronegativity on hyperconjugation, the impact of steric clashes on stereochemical outcome of reactions, and the consequence of resonance on the shape of molecules to rationalize experimental observations. While computational chemists speak about electron densities and molecular orbitals, organic chemists speak about partial charges and localized molecular orbitals. Attempts to reconcile these two parallel approaches such as programs for natural bond orbitals and intrinsic atomic orbitals computing Lewis structures-like orbitals and reaction mechanism have appeared. In the past, we have shown that encoding and quantifying chemistry knowledge and qualitative principles can lead to predictive methods. In the same vein, we thought to understand the conformational behaviors of molecules and to encode this knowledge back into a molecular mechanics tool computing conformational potential energy and to develop an alternative to atom types and training of force fields on large sets of molecules. Herein, we describe a conceptually new approach to model torsion energies based on fundamental chemistry principles. To demonstrate our approach, torsional energy parameters were derived on-the-fly from atomic properties. When the torsional energy terms implemented in GAFF, Parm@Frosst, and MMFF94 were substituted by our method, the accuracy of these force fields to reproduce MP2-derived torsional energy profiles and their transferability to a variety of functional groups and drug fragments were overall improved. In addition, our method did not rely on atom types and consequently did not suffer from poor automated atom type assignments.},

  abstract = {A major goal in drug design is the improvement of computational methods for docking and scoring. The Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR) aims to collect available data from industry and academia which may be used for this purpose ( www.csardock.org ). Also, CSAR is charged with organizing community-wide exercises based on the collected data. The first of these exercises was aimed to gauge the overall state of docking and scoring, using a large and diverse data set of protein?ligand complexes. Participants were asked to calculate the affinity of the complexes as provided and then recalculate with changes which may improve their specific method. This first data set was selected from existing PDB entries which had binding data (Kd or Ki) in Binding MOAD, augmented with entries from PDBbind. The final data set contains 343 diverse protein?ligand complexes and spans 14 pKd. Sixteen proteins have three or more complexes in the data set, from which a user could start an inspection of congeneric series. Inherent experimental error limits the possible correlation between scores and measured affinity; R2 is limited to ?0.9 when fitting to the data set without over parametrizing. R2 is limited to ?0.8 when scoring the data set with a method trained on outside data. The details of how the data set was initially selected, and the process by which it matured to better fit the needs of the community are presented. Many groups generously participated in improving the data set, and this underscores the value of a supportive, collaborative effort in moving our field forward.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

As expected, the relative changes in the complex stability constants upon addition of urea have been found to depend on the balance of opposing enthalpic and entropic contributions. The interpretation as well as the magnitude of the interaction between urea and aromatic surfaces are in line with previous experimental and computational studies. The experimental evidence presented in this work provides insight into the mechanism by which large amounts of urea denature globular proteins in aqueous media.},

  abstract = {The quality of atomistic simulations depends decisively on the accuracy of the underlying energy function (force field). Of particular importance for condensed-phase properties are nonbonded interactions, including the electrostatic and Lennard-Jones terms. Permanent atomic multipoles (MTPs) are an extension to common point-charge (PC) representations in atomistic simulations. MTPs are commonly determined from and fitted to an ab initio Electrostatic Potential (ESP), and Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters are obtained from comparison of experimental and computed observables using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For this a set of thermodynamic observables such as density, heat of vaporization, and hydration free energy is chosen, to which the parametrization is fitted. The current work introduces a comprehensive computing environment (Fitting Wizard (FW)) for optimizing nonbonded interactions for atomistic force fields of different qualities. The FW supports fitting of standard PC-based force fields and more physically motivated multipolar (MTP) force fields. A broader study including 20 molecules ranging from N-methyl-acetamide and benzene to halogenated benzenes, phenols, anilines, and pyridines yields a root mean squared deviation for hydration free energies of 0.36 kcal/mol over a range of 8 kcal/mol. It is furthermore shown that PC-based force fields are not necessarily inferior compared to MTP parametrizations depending on the molecule considered.},

  doi = {10.1002/jcc.24488},
  abstract = {Previous free-energy calculations have shown that the seemingly simple transformation of the tripeptide KXK to KGK in water holds some unobvious challenges concerning the convergence of the forward and backward thermodynamic integration processes (i.e., hysteresis). In the current study, the central residue X was either alanine, serine, glutamic acid, lysine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine. Interestingly, the transformation from alanine to glycine yielded the highest hysteresis in relation to the extent of the chemical change of the side chain. The reason for that could be attributed to poor sampling of $\varphi$2/$\psi$2 dihedral angles along the transformation. Altering the nature of alanine's C$\beta$ atom drastically improved the sampling and at the same time led to the identification of high energy barriers as cause for it. Consequently, simple strategies to overcome these barriers are to increase simulation time (computationally expensive) or to use enhanced sampling techniques such as Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics and one-step perturbation. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

We use an explicit-water model to precompute properties of water solvation shells around simple spheres, then assemble a solute's solvation shell by combining the shells of these spheres. SEA improves upon implicit-solvent models of solvation free energies by accounting for local solute curvature, accounting for near-neighbor nonadditivities, and treating water's dipole as being asymmetrical with respect to positive or negative solute charges. SEA does not involve parameter fitting, because parameters come from the given underlying explicit-solvation model. SEA is about as accurate as explicit simulations as shown by comparisons against four different homologous alkyl series, a set of 504 varied solutes, solutes taken retrospectively from two solvation-prediction events, and a hypothetical polar-solute series, and SEA is about 100-fold faster than Poisson\textendash{}Boltzmann calculations.},

SEA was developed with the intention of being as accurate as explicit-solvent models, but much faster to compute. It is accurate because it uses pre-simulations of simple spheres in explicit solvent to obtain structural and thermodynamic quantities, and it is fast because it parses solute free energies into regionally additive quantities. SAMPL4 provided us the opportunity to make new tests of SEA. Our tests here lead us to the following conclusions: (1) The newest version, called Field-SEA, which gives improved predictions for highly charged ions, is shown here to perform as well as the earlier versions (dipolar and quadrupolar SEA) on this broad blind SAMPL4 test set. (2) We find that both the past and present SEA models give solvation free energies that are as accurate as TIP3P. (3) Using a new approach for force field parameter optimization, we developed improved hydroxyl parameters that ensure consistency with neat-solvent dielectric constants, and found that they led to improved solvation free energies for hydroxyl-containing compounds in SAMPL4. We also learned that these hydroxyl parameters are not just fixing solvent exposed oxygens in a general sense, and therefore do not improve predictions for carbonyl or carboxylic-acid groups. Other such functional groups will need their own independent optimizations for potential improvements. Overall, these tests in SAMPL4 indicate that SEA is an accurate, general and fast new approach to computing solvation free energies.},

Accurate estimations of transfer between phases with significantly different polarities can be difficult because of the static nature of the force fields. Here, we report on an application of such calculations in the SAMPL5 experiment that also involves an effort in balancing solute and solvent interactions via their expected static dielectric constants. This strategy performs well with respect to predictive accuracy and correlation with unknown experimental values. We follow this by performing a series of retrospective investigations which highlight the potential importance of proper balancing in these systems, and we use a null hypothesis analysis to explore potential biases in the comparisons with experiment. The collective findings indicate that considerations of force field compatibility through dielectric behavior is a potential strategy for future improvements in transfer processes between disparate environments.},

  abstract = {The Conductor-Like-Screening-Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) method has been used for the blind prediction of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients logD within the SAMPL challenge. The partition coefficient logP of the neutral species was calculated first and then corrected for dissociation or protonation, as appropriate for acidic or basic solutes, to obtain the cyclohexane-water logD. Using the latest version of the COSMOtherm implementation, this approach in combination with a rigorous conformational sampling yielded a predictive accuracy of 2.11 log units (RMSD) for the 53 compounds of the blind prediction dataset. By that it was the most accurate of all contest submissions and it also achieved the best rank order. The RMSD mainly arises from a group of outliers in the negative logD range, which at least partly may arise from dimerization or other experimental problems coming up for very polar molecules in very non-polar solvents.},

  abstract = {After 20 years of sometimes quiet growth, fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has become mainstream. More than 30 drug candidates derived from fragments have entered the clinic, with two approved and several more in advanced trials. FBDD has been widely applied in both academia and industry, as evidenced by the large number of papers from universities, non-profit research institutions, biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, FBDD draws on a diverse range of disciplines, from biochemistry and biophysics to computational and medicinal chemistry. As the promise of FBDD strategies becomes increasingly realized, now is an opportune time to draw lessons and point the way to the future. This Review briefly discusses how to design fragment libraries, how to select screening techniques and how to make the most of information gleaned from them. It also shows how concepts from FBDD have permeated and enhanced drug discovery efforts.},

This task involves the coupled problem of predicting both partition coefficients (log P) of neutral species between the solvents and aqueous acidity constants (pKa) in order to account for a change of protonation states. The first issue is addressed by calibrating an EC-RISM-based model for solvation free energies derived from the ``Minnesota Solvation Database'' (MNSOL) for both water and cyclohexane utilizing a correction based on the partial molar volume, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.4 kcal mol-1 for water and 0.8\textendash{}0.9 kcal mol-1 for cyclohexane depending on the parametrization. The second one is treated by employing on one hand an empirical pKa model (MoKa) and, on the other hand, an EC-RISM-derived regression of published acidity constants (RMSE of 1.5 for a single model covering acids and bases). In total, at most 8 adjustable parameters are necessary (2\textendash{}3 for each solvent and two for the pKa) for training solvation and acidity models. Applying the final models to the log D7.4 dataset corresponds to evaluating an independent test set comprising other, composite observables, yielding, for different cyclohexane parametrizations, 2.0\textendash{}2.1 for the RMSE with the first and 2.2\textendash{}2.8 with the combined first and second SAMPL5 data set batches. Notably, a pure log P model (assuming neutral species only) performs statistically similarly for these particular compounds. The nature of the approximations and possible perspectives for future developments are discussed.},

Based on molecular dynamics trajectories with the CHARMM General Force Field, we compare pure molecular mechanics (MM) with quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations based on QM/MM schemes that treat the solvent at the MM level. We perform QM/MM with both density functional theory (BLYP) and semi-empirical methods (OM1, OM2, OM3, PM3). The calculations also serve to test the sensitivity of partition coefficients to solute polarizability as well as the interplay of the quantum-mechanical region with the fixed-charge molecular mechanics environment. Our results indicate that QM/MM with both BLYP and OM2 outperforms pure MM. However, this observation is limited to a subset of cases where convergence of the free energy can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Implicit solvent methods for classical molecular modeling are frequently used to provide fast, physics-based hydration free energies of macromolecules. Less commonly considered is the transferability of these methods to other solvents. The Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands 5 (SAMPL5) distribution coefficient dataset and the accompanying explicit solvent partition coefficient reference calculations provide a direct test of solvent model transferability. Here we use the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) statistical-mechanical solvation theory, with a well tested water model and a new united atom cyclohexane model, to calculate partition coefficients for the SAMPL5 dataset. The cyclohexane model performed well in training and testing (R=0.98R=0.98 for amino acid neutral side chain analogues) but only if a parameterized solvation free energy correction was used. In contrast, the same protocol, using single solute conformations, performed poorly on the SAMPL5 dataset, obtaining R=0.73R=0.73 compared to the reference partition coefficients, likely due to the much larger solute sizes. Including solute conformational sampling through molecular dynamics coupled with 3D-RISM (MD/3D-RISM) improved agreement with the reference calculation to R=0.93R=0.93. Since our initial calculations only considered partition coefficients and not distribution coefficients, solute sampling provided little benefit comparing against experiment, where ionized and tautomer states are more important. Applying a simple pKa$\backslash$hbox \{p\}K\_\{$\backslash$text \{a\}\} correction improved agreement with experiment from R=0.54R=0.54 to R=0.66R=0.66, despite a small number of outliers. Better agreement is possible by accounting for tautomers and improving the ionization correction.},

Our method is purely empirical and based on the additive contribution of each solute atom to the free energy of solvation in water and in cyclohexane. The contribution of each atom depends on the atom type and on the exposed surface area. Comparatively to similar methods in the literature, we used a very small set of atomic parameters: only 10 for solvation in water and 1 for solvation in cyclohexane. As a result, the method is protected from overfitting and the error in the blind predictions could be reasonably estimated. Moreover, this approach is fast: it takes only 0.5 s to predict the distribution coefficient for all 53 SAMPL5 compounds, allowing its application in virtual screening campaigns. The performance of our approach (submission 49) is modest but satisfactory in view of its efficiency: the root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.3 log D units for the 53 compounds, while the RMSE of the best performing method (using COSMO-RS) was 2.1 (submission 16).

This computational blind challenge involved predicting protein\textendash{}ligand binding against the three allosteric sites of HIV integrase (IN), a viral enzyme for which two drugs (that target the active site) have been approved by the FDA. Positive control cross-docking experiments were utilized to select 13 receptor models out of an initial ensemble of 41 different crystal structures of HIV IN. These 13 models of the targets were selected using our new ``Rank Difference Ratio'' metric. The first stage of SAMPL4 involved using virtual screens to identify 62 active, allosteric IN inhibitors out of a set of 321 compounds. The second stage involved predicting the binding site(s) and crystallographic binding mode(s) for 57 of these inhibitors. Our team submitted four entries for the first stage that utilized: (1) AutoDock Vina (AD Vina) plus visual inspection; (2) a new common pharmacophore engine; (3) BEDAM replica exchange free energy simulations, and a Consensus approach that combined the predictions of all three strategies. Even with the SAMPL4's very challenging compound library that displayed a significantly lower amount of structural diversity than most libraries that are conventionally employed in prospective virtual screens, these approaches produced hit rates of 24, 25, 34, and 27 \%, respectively, on a set with 19 \% declared binders. Our only entry for the second stage challenge was based on the results of AD Vina plus visual inspection, and it ranked third place overall according to several different metrics provided by the SAMPL4 organizers. The successful results displayed by these approaches highlight the utility of the computational structure-based drug discovery tools and strategies that are being developed to advance the goals of the newly created, multi-institution, NIH-funded center called the ``HIV Interaction and Viral Evolution Center''.},

We employed two solvation models for this challenge, a linear interaction energy (LIE) model based on explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations, and the first-shell hydration (FiSH) continuum model previously calibrated to mimic LIE data. On the 23 compounds from the obscure (blind) dataset, the prospectively submitted LIE and FiSH models provided predictions highly correlated with experimental hydration free energy data, with mean-unsigned-errors of 1.69 and 1.71 kcal/mol, respectively. We investigated several parameters that may affect the performance of these models, namely, the solute flexibility for the LIE explicit-solvent model, the solute partial charging method, and the incorporation of the difference in intramolecular energy between gas and solution phases for both models. We extended this analysis to the various chemical classes that can be formed within the SAMPL2 dataset. Our results strengthen previous findings on the excellent accuracy and transferability of the LIE explicit-solvent approach to predict transfer free energies across a wide spectrum of functional classes. Further, the current results on the SAMPL2 test dataset provide additional support for the FiSH continuum model as a fast yet accurate alternative to the LIE explicit-solvent model. Overall, both the LIE explicit-solvent model and the FiSH continuum solvation model show considerable improvement on the SAMPL2 data set over our previous continuum electrostatics-dispersion solvation model used in the SAMPL1 blind challenge.},

  abstract = {The correct representation of solute-water interactions is essential for the accurate simulation of most biological phenomena. Several highly accurate quantum methods are available to deal with solvation by using both implicit and explicit solvents. So far, however, most evaluations of those methods were based on a single conformation, which neglects solute entropy. Here, we present the first test of a novel approach to determine hydration free energies that uses molecular mechanics (MM) to sample phase space and quantum mechanics (QM) to evaluate the potential energies. Free energies are determined by using re-weighting with the Non-Boltzmann Bennett (NBB) method. In this context, the method is referred to as QM-NBB. Based on snapshots from MM sampling and accounting for their correct Boltzmann weight, it is possible to obtain hydration free energies that incorporate the effect of solute entropy. We evaluate the performance of several QM implicit solvent models, as well as explicit solvent QM/MM for the blind subset of the SAMPL4 hydration free energy challenge. While classical free energy simulations with molecular dynamics give root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, the hybrid approach yields an improved RMSD of 1.6 kcal/mol. By selecting an appropriate functional and basis set, the RMSD can be reduced to 1 kcal/mol for calculations based on a single conformation. Results for a selected set of challenging molecules imply that this RMSD can be further reduced by using NBB to reweight MM trajectories with the SMD implicit solvent model.},

Regular docking only performed slightly better than random selection, but the performance was significantly improved upon incorporation of additional filters based on pharmacophore queries and electrostatic similarities. The best performance was achieved when logical selection was added. For the pose prediction, we utilized a similar consensus approach that amalgamated the results of the Glide-XP docking with structural knowledge and rescoring. The pose prediction results revealed that docking displayed reasonable performance in predicting the binding poses. However, prediction performance can be improved utilizing scientific experience and rescoring approaches. In both the virtual screening and pose prediction challenges, the top performance was achieved by our approaches. Here we describe the methods and strategies used in our approaches and discuss the rationale of their performances.},

  abstract = {Relative free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations are combined with available experimental binding free energies to predict unknown binding affinities of acyclic Cucurbituril complexes in the blind SAMPL3 competition. The predictions yield root mean square errors between 2.6 and 3.2 kcal/mol for seven host-guest systems. Those deviations are comparable to results for solvation free energies of small organic molecules. However, the standard deviations found in our simulations range from 0.4 to 2.4 kcal/mol, which indicates the need for better sampling. Three different approaches are compared. Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method and thermodynamic integration based on the trapezoidal rule with 12 $\lambda$-points exhibit a root mean square error of 2.6 kcal/mol, while thermodynamic integration with Simpson's rule and 11 $\lambda$-points leads to a root mean square error of 3.2 kcal/mol. In terms of absolute median errors, Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method performs better than thermodynamic integration with the trapezoidal rule (1.7 vs. 2.9 kcal/mol). Simulations of the deprotonated forms of the guest molecules exhibit a poorer correspondence to experimental results with a root mean square error of 5.2 kcal/mol. In addition, a decrease of the buffer concentration by approximately 20 mM in the simulations raises the root mean square error to 3.8 kcal/mol.},

We compared our SEA results with full molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Of the 20 submissions, our SEA/OPLS results gave the second smallest RMS errors in free energies compared to experiments. SEA gives results that are very similar to those of its underlying force field and explicit solvent model. Hence, while the SEA water modeling approach is much faster than explicit solvent simulations, its predictions appear to be just as accurate.},

Our study reaffirmed that the real test for any virtual screening approach would be in a blind testing environment. The analyses presented in this paper also showed that virtual screening performance can be improved, if a set of known active compounds is available and parameters and methods that yield better enrichment are selected. Our study also highlighted that to achieve accurate orientation and conformation of ligands within a binding site, selecting an appropriate method to calculate partial charges is important. Another finding is that using multiple receptor ensembles in docking does not always yield better enrichment than individual receptors. On the basis of our results and retrospective analyses from SAMPL3 fragment screening challenge we anticipate that chances of success in a fragment screening process could be increased significantly with careful selection of receptor structures, protein flexibility, sufficient conformational sampling within binding pocket and accurate assignment of ligand and protein partial charges.},

We also determine an optimal restraint weight for Dielectric-RESP atomic charges fitting. Statistical analysis of the results could not distinguish the methods from one another. The smallest average unsigned error obtained is 1.9 $\pm$ 0.6 kcal/mol (95\% confidence level). A class of outliers led us to investigate the importance of the solute\textendash{}solvent instantaneous induction energy, a missing term in PB continuum models. We estimated values between -1.5 and -6 kcal/mol for a series of halo-benzenes which can explain why some predicted hydration energies of non-polar molecules significantly disagreed with experiment.},

We show that by using multiple independent simulations, including different starting configurations, and enhanced sampling with parallel tempering, we can obtain well converged hydration free energies. Additional analysis using dihedral angle distributions, torsion-root mean square deviation plots and thermodynamic cycles support this assertion.

In this parameterization, we used a training set comprising 77 organic molecules with varying sizes and shapes. The estimated hydration free energies for the SAMPL4 molecules compared reasonably well with the experimental results with the associated squared correlation coefficient and root mean square deviation of 0.89 and 1.46 kcal/mol, respectively.

Compounds were parametrized on the basis of the OPLS-AA force field using three different protocols for deriving partial charges: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms and derivation of new parameters for a number of distinct chemical groups (N-alkyl imidazole, nitrate) that were not present in the published force field; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian09 at the HF/6-31G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. The absolute hydration free energy was computed by an established protocol including alchemical free energy perturbation with thermodynamic integration. The use of standard OPLS-AA charges (protocol 1) with a number of newly parametrized charges and the use of histidine derived parameters for imidazole yielded an overall root mean square deviation of the prediction from the experimental data of 1.75 kcal/mol. The precision of our results appears to be mainly limited by relatively poor reproducibility of the Lennard-Jones contribution towards the solvation free energy, for which we observed large variability that could be traced to a strong dependence on the initial system conditions.},

Wilma\textendash{}SIE provides good correlations with actual binding affinities over a wide range of binding affinities that includes strong binders as in the case of SAMPL4 host\textendash{}guest systems. Absolute binding affinities are also reproduced with appropriate training of the scoring function on available data sets or from comparative estimation of the change in target's vibrational entropy. Even when binding modes are known, SIE predictions lack correlation with experimental affinities within dynamic ranges below 2 kcal/mol as in the case of HIV-integrase ligands, but they correctly signaled the narrowness of the dynamic range. Using a common protein structure for all ligands can reduce the noise, while incorporating a more sophisticated solvation treatment improves absolute predictions. The HIV-integrase virtual screening data set consists of promiscuous weak binders with relatively high flexibility and thus it falls outside of the applicability domain of the Wilma\textendash{}SIE docking platform. Despite these difficulties, unbiased docking around three known binding sites of the enzyme resulted in over a third of ligands being docked within 2 {\AA} from their actual poses and over half of the ligands docked in the correct site, leading to better-than-random virtual screening results.},

  abstract = {Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases---such as cyclohexane and water--- the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water- saturated octanol phases, since it has which has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.},

  abstract = {The success of molecular fragment-based design depends critically on the ability to make predictions of binding poses and of affinity ranking for compounds assembled by linking fragments. The SAMPL3 Challenge provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art fragment-based design methodology with respect to these requirements. In this article, we present results derived from linking fragments to predict affinity and pose in the SAMPL3 Challenge. The goal is to demonstrate how incorporating different aspects of modeling protein\textendash{}ligand interactions impact the accuracy of the predictions, including protein dielectric models, charged versus neutral ligands, $\Delta\Delta$Gs solvation energies, and induced conformational stress. The core method is based on annealing of chemical potential in a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GC/MC) simulation. By imposing an initially very high chemical potential and then automatically running a sequence of simulations at successively decreasing chemical potentials, the GC/MC simulation efficiently discovers statistical distributions of bound fragment locations and orientations not found reliably without the annealing. This method accounts for configurational entropy, the role of bound water molecules, and results in a prediction of all the locations on the protein that have any affinity for the fragment. Disregarding any of these factors in affinity-rank prediction leads to significantly worse correlation with experimentally-determined free energies of binding. We relate three important conclusions from this challenge as applied to GC/MC: (1) modeling neutral ligands\textemdash{}regardless of the charged state in the active site\textemdash{}produced better affinity ranking than using charged ligands, although, in both cases, the poses were almost exactly overlaid; (2) simulating explicit water molecules in the GC/MC gave better affinity and pose predictions; and (3) applying a $\Delta\Delta$Gs solvation correction further improved the ranking of the neutral ligands. Using the GC/MC method under a variety of parameters in the blinded SAMPL3 Challenge provided important insights to the relevant parameters and boundaries in predicting binding affinities using simulated annealing of chemical potential calculations.},

  abstract = {The COSMO-RS method, a combination of the quantum chemical dielectric continuum solvation model COSMO with a COSMO based statistical thermodynamics of surface interactions, has been used in its COSMOtherm implementation for the direct, blind prediction of tautomeric equilibria within the SAMPL2 challenge. Since the quantum chemical level underlying COSMOtherm, i.e. BP/TZVP DFT-calculations, is known to be of limited accuracy with respect to reaction energies, we tested MP2 reaction energy corrections in addition. As expected, the straight application of the latest version of COSMOtherm yielded a poor predictive accuracy of \textasciitilde{}4 kcal/mol (RMSE) for the eight compounds of the blind prediction data set, and the MP2-corrected predictions reduced the average error considerably to \textasciitilde{}1.2 kcal/mol. But a more detailed analysis shows that this improvement is not systematic and mostly a lucky coincidence on the small data set. The systematic results of COSMOtherm allow for an efficient empirical correction with an RMSE of 0.61 kcal/mol. This allows for systematic predictions for the most important case of generalized keto-enol tautomerism.},

The theoretical calculations were carried out with the TIP3P water model and different combinations of solute configurations and molecular force fields. In comparison with the experimental data, the blind test yields an average unsigned error of 2.38 kcal/mol and the root mean square deviation of 2.99 kcal/mol. Whereas these numbers are significantly larger than the best results from explicit-solvent MD simulations, we find that the theoretical performance is sensitive to both the molecular force fields and solute configurations and that a comparable level of accuracy can be achieved by a judicious selection of the solute configurations and the force-field parameters. Most importantly, CDFT reduces the computational cost of MD simulation by almost 3 orders of magnitude, making it very attractive for large-scale hydration free-energy calculations (e.g., screening the aqueous solubility of drug-like molecules).},

The AM1-BCC, restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and IpolQ-Mod approaches all perform reasonably well (R2 $>$ 0.8), while VCharge, though faster, gives less accurate results (R2 of 0.5). The AM1-BCC results are more accurate than those of RESP for tertiary amines and nitrates, but the overall difference in accuracy between these methods is not statistically significant. Interestingly, the IPolQ-Mod method is found to yield partial charges in very close agreement with RESP. This observation suggests that the success of RESP may be attributed to its fortuitously approximating the arguably more rigorous IPolQ approach.},

In addition, binding enthalpies for the benzimidazoles were calculated with density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP functional and a polarizable continuum model (PCM). Although in most cases the MMFF/PB approach returned reasonable agreements with the experiment ($\pm$2 kcal/mol), significant, much larger deviations were reported in the case of three host-guest pairs. All four binding enthalpy predictions with the DFT/PCM method suffered 70\% or larger deviations from the calorimetry data. Results are discussed in terms of the molecular models used for guest-host complexation and the quality of the intermolecular potentials.},

Here we tested prospectively the FiSH model on the SAMPL-3 hydration data set that zooms in the effect of chlorination on solvation. We compare these FiSH predictions with those from retrospective LIE calculations. We find that neither FiSH nor LIE can reproduce well the absolute values and the trend of hydration free energies in the biphenyl and dioxin aromatic chlorination series. Some of the hypotheses behind this performance are discussed and tested.

Over 60 sets of predictions were submitted, and each participant also attempted to estimate the error in their predictions, a task that proved difficult for most. The results of this blind assessment of the state of the field for transfer energy and tautomer ratio prediction both indicate where the field is performing well and point out flaws in current methods.},

  abstract = {We applied the solvation models SM8, SM8AD, and SMD in combination with the Minnesota M06-2X density functional to predict vacuum-water transfer free energies (Task 1) and tautomeric ratios in aqueous solution (Task 2) for the SAMPL2 test set. The bulk-electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation is treated as follows: SM8 employs the generalized Born model with the Coulomb field approximation, SM8AD employs the generalized Born approximation with asymmetric descreening, and SMD solves the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation. The non-bulk-electrostatic contribution arising from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell is treated as a sum of terms that are products of geometry-dependent atomic surface tensions and solvent-accessible surface areas of the individual atoms of the solute. On average, three models tested in the present work perform similarly. In particular, we achieved mean unsigned errors of 1.3 (SM8), 2.0 (SM8AD), and 2.6 kcal/mol (SMD) for the aqueous free energies of 30 out of 31 compounds with known reference data involved in Task 1 and mean unsigned errors of 2.7 (SM8), 1.8 (SM8AD), and 2.4 kcal/mol (SMD) in the free energy differences (tautomeric ratios) for 21 tautomeric pairs in aqueous solution involved in Task 2.},

  abstract = {The SAMPL-1 hydration free energy blind prediction challenge data set includes 63 compounds that are more chemically diverse, polyfunctional, drug-like, and with examples of transfer free energies and molecular weights larger than ever before seen in previously tabulated data sets of neutral compounds. For the prospective SAMPL-1 study, we employed a continuum model including a boundary element solution of the Poisson equation to describe electrostatic solvation, a molecular surface area-based cost of cavity formation in water, and a continuum Lennard-Jones potential to account for dispersion-repulsion solute-solvent effects. For the latter contribution, continuum van der Waals atom-type coefficients were calibrated and validated on previously available hydration data sets. In the prospective study, this continuum hydration model yielded SAMPL-1 predictions highly correlated with experimental data, albeit with a slope of slightly above 0.5, suggesting a valid model but with a systematic error. Analysis of the major outliers, all overestimating the experimental hydration data, highlights a common structural theme as a possible cause of the prediction errors: densely polar and hydrogen-bond-capable structures, featuring primarily substituted (sulfon)amide groups, often in conjugated systems. By examining analog pairs within the SAMPL-1 data set, it was also noted that certain solvation trends are captured neither by chemical sense nor by our hydration model, which seem too additive. A retrospective analysis of model transferability between hydration data sets as a function of its parameters and complexity indicates that the electrostatic component of the model is fairly transferrable across data sets, but the nonelectrostatic terms are less so. For the chemical space covered in SAMPL-1, absolute prediction errors indicate that the simpler transferrable electrostatics-only model outperforms the more complex model including cavity and continuum dispersion terms. Possible directions to further improve this continuum hydration model are proposed.},

The modeling predictions, conducted as part of the SAMPL3 host-guest affinity blind challenge, are generally in good quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. The correlation coefficient between computed and measured binding free energies is 70\% with high statistical significance. Multiple conformational stereoisomers and protonation states of the guests have been considered. Better agreement is obtained with high statistical confidence under acidic modeling conditions. It is shown that this level of quantitative agreement could have not been reached without taking into account reorganization energy and configurational entropy effects. Extensive conformational variability of the host, the guests and their complexes is observed in the simulations, affecting binding free energy estimates and structural predictions. A conformational reservoir technique is introduced as part of the parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics BEDAM protocol to fully capture conformational variability. It is shown that these advanced computational strategies lead to converged free energy estimates for these systems, offering the prospect of utilizing host-guest binding free energy data for force field validation and development.},

  abstract = {We have estimated affinities for the binding of 34 ligands to trypsin and nine guest molecules to three different hosts in the SAMPL3 blind challenge, using the MM/PBSA, MM/GBSA, LIE, continuum LIE, and Glide score methods. For the trypsin challenge, none of the methods were able to accurately predict the experimental results. For the MM/GB(PB)SA and LIE methods, the rankings were essentially random and the mean absolute deviations were much worse than a null hypothesis giving the same affinity to all ligand. Glide scoring gave a Kendall's $\tau$ index better than random, but the ranking is still only mediocre, $\tau$ = 0.2. However, the range of affinities is small and most of the pairs of ligands have an experimental affinity difference that is not statistically significant. Removing those pairs improves the ranking metric to 0.4\textendash{}1.0 for all methods except CLIE. Half of the trypsin ligands were non-binders according to the binding assay. The LIE methods could not separate the inactive ligands from the active ones better than a random guess, whereas MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA were slightly better than random (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, AUC = 0.65\textendash{}0.68), and Glide scoring was even better (AUC = 0.79). For the first host, MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA reproduce the experimental ranking fairly good, with $\tau$ = 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, whereas the Glide scoring was considerably worse, with a $\tau$ = 0.4, highlighting that the success of the methods is system-dependent.},

This focused set of molecules were then provided as a blinded challenge to assess the ability of current computational solvation methods to accurately model the interactions between water and increasingly chlorinated compounds. This was presented as part of the SAMPL3 challenge, which represented the fourth iterative blind prediction challenge involving transfer energies. The results of this exercise demonstrate that the field in general has difficulty predicting the transfer energies of more highly chlorinated compounds, and that methods seem to be erring in the same direction.},

  abstract = {For the fifth time I have provided a set of solvation energies (1 M gas to 1 M aqueous) for a SAMPL challenge. In this set there are 23 blind compounds and 30 supplementary compounds of related structure to one of the blind sets, but for which the solvation energy is readily available. The best current values of each compound are presented along with complete documentation of the experimental origins of the solvation energies. The calculations needed to go from reported data to solvation energies are presented, with particular attention to aspects which are new to this set. For some compounds the vapor pressures (VP) were reported for the liquid compound, which is solid at room temperature. To correct from VPsubcooled liquid to VPsublimation requires $\Delta$Sfusion, which is only known for mannitol. Estimated values were used for the others, all but one of which were benzene derivatives and expected to have very similar values. The final compound for which $\Delta$Sfusion was estimated was menthol, which melts at 42 $^\circ$C so that modest errors in $\Delta$Sfusion will have little effect. It was also necessary to look into the effects of including estimated values of $\Delta$Cp on this correction. The approximate sizes of the effects of inclusion of $\Delta$Cp in the correction from VPsubcooledliquid to VPsublimation were estimated and it was noted that inclusion of $\Delta$Cp invariably makes $\Delta$GS more positive. To extend the set of compounds for which the solvation energy could be calculated we explored the use of boiling point (b.p.) data from Reaxys/Beilstein as a substitute for studies of the VP as a function of temperature. B.p. data are not always reliable so it was necessary to develop a criterion for rejecting outliers. For two compounds (chlorinated guaiacols) it became clear that inclusion represented overreach; for each there were only two independent pressure, temperature points, which is too little for a trustworthy extrapolation. For a number of compounds the extrapolation from lowest temperature at which the VP was reported to 25 $^\circ$C was long (sometimes over 100$^\circ$) so that it was necessary to consider whether $\Delta$Cp might have significant effects. The problem is that there are no experimental values and possible intramolecular hydrogen bonds make estimation uncertain in some cases. The approximate sizes of the effects of $\Delta$Cp were estimated, and it was noted that inclusion of $\Delta$Cp in the extrapolation of VP down to room temperature invariably makes $\Delta$Gs more negative.},

Computations of hydration free energies was performed using both HF/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-31G(d) versions of the IEF-MST model. For tautomeric preferences, the IEF-MST data was combined with the gas phase free energy differences predicted at different levels of theory ranging from MP2/6-31+G(d) to MP2/CBS+[CCSD-MP2/6-31+G(d)] levels. Comparison with the experimental data provided for hydration free energies yields a root-mean square deviation (rmsd) close to 2.3 kcal/mol, which is quite remarkable, especially considering the reduced set of training compounds used in the parametrization of the IEF-MST method. With regard to tautomerism, the lowest error in the prediction of the relative stabilities between tautomers in solution is obtained by combining MP2/CBS+[CCSD-MP2/6-31+G(d)] results with IEF-MST hydration free energies, yielding a rmsd of ca. 3.4 kcal/mol. The results illustrate the delicate balance that must be kept between the intrinsic relative stabilities in the gas phase and the differential hydration preferences in order to obtain an accurate description of the prototropic tautomerism in bioorganic compounds.},

  abstract = {We present blind predictions using the solubility parameter based method MOSCED submitted for the SAMPL5 challenge on calculating cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients at 298 K. Reference data to parameterize MOSCED was generated with knowledge only of chemical structure by performing solvation free energy calculations using electronic structure calculations in the SMD continuum solvent. To maintain simplicity and use only a single method, we approximate the distribution coefficient with the partition coefficient of the neutral species. Over the final SAMPL5 set of 53 compounds, we achieved an average unsigned error of 2.2$\pm$0.22.2$\pm$0.22.2$\backslash$pm 0.2 log units (ranking 15 out of 62 entries), the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.6$\pm$0.10.6$\pm$0.10.6$\backslash$pm 0.1 (ranking 35), and 72$\pm$6\%72$\pm$6\%72$\backslash$pm 6$\backslash$,$\backslash$\% of the predictions had the correct sign (ranking 30). While used here to predict cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients at 298 K, MOSCED is broadly applicable, allowing one to predict temperature dependent infinite dilution activity coefficients in any solvent for which parameters exist, and provides a means by which an excess Gibbs free energy model may be parameterized to predict composition dependent phase-equilibrium.},

  abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to predict water-cyclohexane distribution coefficients DcwDcwD\_\{cw\} of a range of small molecules as part of the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge. Molecules were parameterized with the transferable all-atom OPLS-AA force field, which required the derivation of new parameters for sulfamides and heterocycles and validation of cyclohexane parameters as a solvent. The distribution coefficient was calculated from the solvation free energies of the compound in water and cyclohexane. Absolute solvation free energies were computed by an established protocol using windowed alchemical free energy perturbation with thermodynamic integration. This protocol resulted in an overall root mean square error in logDcwlog⁡Dcw$\backslash$log D\_\{cw\} of almost 4 log units and an overall signed error of -3 compared to experimental data. There was no substantial overall difference in accuracy between simulating in NVT and NPT ensembles. The signed error suggests a systematic error but the experimental DcwDcwD\_\{cw\} data on their own are insufficient to uncover the source of this error. Preliminary work suggests that the major source of error lies in the hydration free energy calculations.},

  abstract = {We have tried to calculate the free energy for the binding of six small ligands to two variants of the octa-acid deep cavitand host in the SAMPL5 blind challenge. We employed structures minimised with dispersion-corrected density-functional theory with small basis sets and energies were calculated using large basis sets. Solvation energies were calculated with continuum methods and thermostatistical corrections were obtained from frequencies calculated at the HF-3c level. Care was taken to minimise the effects of the flexibility of the host by keeping the complexes as symmetric and similar as possible. In some calculations, the large net charge of the host was reduced by removing the propionate and benzoate groups. In addition, the effect of a restricted molecular dynamics sampling of structures was tested. Finally, we tried to improve the energies by using the DLPNO\textendash{}CCSD(T) approach. Unfortunately, results of quite poor quality were obtained, with no correlation to the experimental data, systematically too positive affinities (by \textasciitilde{}50 kJ/mol) and a mean absolute error (after removal of the systematic error) of 11\textendash{}16 kJ/mol. DLPNO\textendash{}CCSD(T) did not improve the results, so the accuracy is not limited by the energy function. Instead, four likely sources of errors were identified: first, the minimised structures were often incorrect, owing to the omission of explicit solvent. They could be partly improved by performing the minimisations in a continuum solvent with four water molecules around the charged groups of the ligands. Second, some ligands could bind in several different conformations, requiring sampling of reasonable structures. Third, there is an indication the continuum-solvation model has problems to accurately describe the binding of both the negatively and positively charged guest molecules. Fourth, different methods to calculate the thermostatistical corrections gave results that differed by up to 30 kJ/mol and there is an indication that HF-3c overestimates the entropy term. In conclusion, it is a challenge to calculate binding affinities for this octa-acid system with quantum\textendash{}mechanical methods.},

Considering the simplicity of the solvent model and that we approximate the distribution coefficient with the partition coefficient of the neutral species, the predictions are of good accuracy. The correlation coefficient, R is 0.64, 82 \% of the predictions have the correct sign and the mean absolute deviation is 1.8 log units.

  abstract = {The performance of the extended solvent-contact model has been addressed in the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge for distribution coefficient (LogD) of drug-like molecules with respect to the cyclohexane/water partitioning system. All the atomic parameters defined for 41 atom types in the solvation free energy function were optimized by operating a standard genetic algorithm with respect to water and cyclohexane solvents. In the parameterizations for cyclohexane, the experimental solvation free energy ($\Delta$Gsol) data of 15 molecules for 1-octanol were combined with those of 77 molecules for cyclohexane to construct a training set because $\Delta$Gsol values of the former were unavailable for cyclohexane in publicly accessible databases. Using this hybrid training set, we established the LogD prediction model with the correlation coefficient (R), average error (AE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.55, 1.53, and 3.03, respectively, for the comparison of experimental and computational results for 53 SAMPL5 molecules. The modest accuracy in LogD prediction could be attributed to the incomplete optimization of atomic solvation parameters for cyclohexane. With respect to 31 SAMPL5 molecules containing the atom types for which experimental reference data for $\Delta$Gsol were available for both water and cyclohexane, the accuracy in LogD prediction increased remarkably with the R, AE, and RMSE values of 0.82, 0.89, and 1.60, respectively. This significant enhancement in performance stemmed from the better optimization of atomic solvation parameters by limiting the element of training set to the molecules with experimental $\Delta$Gsol data for cyclohexane. Due to the simplicity in model building and to low computational cost for parameterizations, the extended solvent-contact model is anticipated to serve as a valuable computational tool for LogD prediction upon the enrichment of experimental $\Delta$Gsol data for organic solvents.},

Since experimental structures of the complexes were not provided, this was an exercise in virtual docking as well. We used our exhaustive docking program, Wilma, to provide high-quality poses that were rescored using SIE to provide binding affinity predictions. We also tested the combination of SIE with our latest solvation model, first shell of hydration (FiSH), which captures some of the discrete properties of water within a continuum model. We achieved good enrichment in virtual screening of fragments against trypsin, with an area under the curve of about 0.7 for the receiver operating characteristic curve. Moreover, the early enrichment performance was quite good with 50\% of true actives recovered with a 15\% false positive rate in a prospective calculation and with a 3\% false positive rate in a retrospective application of SIE with FiSH. Binding affinity predictions for both trypsin and host\textendash{}guest complexes were generally within 2 kcal/mol of the experimental values. However, the rank ordering of affinities differing by 2 kcal/mol or less was not well predicted. On the other hand, it was encouraging that the incorporation of a more sophisticated solvation model into SIE resulted in better discrimination of true binders from binders. This suggests that the inclusion of proper Physics in our models is a fruitful strategy for improving the reliability of our binding affinity predictions.},

  abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations were used to blindly predict the hydration free energies of a range of chloro-organic compounds as part of the SAMPL3 challenge. All compounds were parameterized within the framework of the OPLS-AA force field, using an established protocol to compute the absolute hydration free energy via a windowed free energy perturbation approach and thermodynamic integration. Three different approaches to deriving partial charge parameters were pursued: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian03 at the HF/6-31G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. Protocol 3 generated the most accurate predictions with a root mean square (RMS) error of 1.2kcalmol-11.2kcalmol-11.2$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\}$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} for the entire data set. It was found that the deficiency of the standard OPLS-AA parameters, protocol 1 (RMS error 2.4kcalmol-12.4kcalmol-12.4$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\}$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} overall), was mostly due to compounds with more than three chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring. For this latter subset, the RMS errors were 1.4kcalmol-11.4kcalmol-11.4$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\}$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} (protocol 3) and 4.3kcalmol-14.3kcalmol-14.3$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\} $\backslash$, $\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} (protocol 1), respectively. We propose new OPLS-AA atom types for aromatic carbon and chlorine atoms in rings with $\geq$4 Cl-substituents that perform better than the best QM-based approach, resulting in an RMS error of 1.2kcalmol-11.2kcalmol-11.2$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\} $\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} for these difficult compounds.},

  abstract = {Two families of binding affinity estimation methodologies are described which were utilized in the SAMPL3 trypsin/fragment binding affinity challenge. The first is a free energy decomposition scheme based on a thermodynamic cycle, which included separate contributions from enthalpy and entropy of binding as well as a solvent contribution. Enthalpic contributions were estimated with PM6-DH2 semiempirical quantum mechanical interaction energies, which were modified with a statistical error correction procedure. Entropic contributions were estimated with the rigid-rotor harmonic approximation, and solvent contributions to the free energy were estimated with several different methods. The second general methodology is the empirical score LISA, which contains several physics-based terms trained with the large PDBBind database of protein/ligand complexes. Here we also introduce LISA+, an updated version of LISA which, prior to scoring, classifies systems into one of four classes based on a ligand's hydrophobicity and molecular weight. Each version of the two methodologies (a total of 11 methods) was trained against a compiled set of known trypsin binders available in the Protein Data Bank to yield scaling parameters for linear regression models. Both raw and scaled scores were submitted to SAMPL3. Variants of LISA showed relatively low absolute errors but also low correlation with experiment, while the free energy decomposition methods had modest success when scaling factors were included. Nonetheless, re-scaled LISA yielded the best predictions in the challenge in terms of RMS error, and six of these models placed in the top ten best predictions by RMS error. This work highlights some of the difficulties of predicting binding affinities of small molecular fragments to protein receptors as well as the benefit of using training data.},

  abstract = {The ``embedded cluster reference interaction site model'' (EC-RISM) approach combines statistical-mechanical integral equation theory and quantum-chemical calculations for predicting thermodynamic data for chemical reactions in solution. The electronic structure of the solute is determined self-consistently with the structure of the solvent that is described by 3D RISM integral equation theory. The continuous solvent-site distribution is mapped onto a set of discrete background charges (``embedded cluster'') that represent an additional contribution to the molecular Hamiltonian. The EC-RISM analysis of the SAMPL2 challenge set of tautomers proceeds in three stages. Firstly, the group of compounds for which quantitative experimental free energy data was provided was taken to determine appropriate levels of quantum-chemical theory for geometry optimization and free energy prediction. Secondly, the resulting workflow was applied to the full set, allowing for chemical interpretations of the results. Thirdly, disclosure of experimental data for parts of the compounds facilitated a detailed analysis of methodical issues and suggestions for future improvements of the model. Without specifically adjusting parameters, the EC-RISM model yields the smallest value of the root mean square error for the first set (0.6 kcal mol-1) as well as for the full set of quantitative reaction data (2.0 kcal mol-1) among the SAMPL2 participants.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms of air-snow exchange of mercury (Hg) during and after atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) remain poorly constrained and this has limited our understanding of the arctic Hg cycle. We measured the Hg concentrations of surface snow through time and carried out flux chamber experiments during AMDE and non-AMDE conditions in the spring of 2006 near Barrow, Alaska. Clear skies, low-velocity onshore winds, and a stable boundary layer characterized the meteorology during this AMDE. Surface snow Hg concentrations (upper 1 cm) increased throughout a 9-day AMDE from background levels (4.1\textendash{}15.5 ng/L) to elevated levels (147 and 237 ng/L) at two sampling sites and returned to near-baseline values within 2 days of AMDE cessation. The Hg concentrations of core samples from the full snowpack did not increase significantly during the AMDE and demonstrate that the Hg enhancement of surface snow resulted from deposition of atmospheric Hg to surface snow. We estimate that complete deposition of background Hg to a height of 200\textendash{}450 m in the near-surface troposphere could account for the Hg gains to surface snow during this event. Snow incubated in field-based flux chambers emitted 4 to 7\% of its total Hg content within 1 day and may represent an upper limit for the photo-reduction rate of ``easily'' reducible Hg in snow under post-AMDE conditions. Full-column snow core samples collected in the late springtime have comparable Hg loads to those observed during the AMDE season and imply that a significant fraction of the Hg deposited during the 3-month AMDE season was retained until snowmelt at this location.},

  abstract = {This paper is an overview of Hg measurements made in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, with an emphasis on the evaluation of the methodological approaches employed in both sampling and analysis between different Hg species as well as the fundamental aspects of their behavior. There have been numerous efforts to measure the concentrations of different Hg species, including gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), and particulate mercury (Hg(p)) in polar environments. The mean concentration value for GEM, if evaluated on the basis of numerous studies conducted previously, was moderately higher in the Arctic region (1.56 ng m-3) than the Antarctic counterpart with the limited data sets (1.08 ng m-3). The mean GEM concentration in the Arctic environment varied moderately between different locations so that the highest mean values occurred in sub-Arctic locations with a complicated climatology (e.g., Kuujjuarapik, Quebec: 1.80 ng m-3), while the lowest one was recorded in Pallas, Finland (1.26 ng m-3). A comparison of temporal patterns between different studies also indicates that rather dynamic variations occur due to the effects of certain phenomenon, known as atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDE). During such depletion events, the GEM concentrations frequently dropped below 1.0 ng m-3, while the RGM and Hg(p) exhibited oposing trends. The distribution of GEM in polar environments is, however, fairly comparable in spatial scale, while those of RGM and Hg(p) vary fairly dynamically in such respects. Evidence suggests that the distribution of Hg species at each measurement site in the polar environments is affected more effectively by site-specific meteorological conditions.},

The energy of the individual encapsulated water molecules decreases with increasing cavity size, because larger cavities allow for the formation of more stable H-bonded networks. Conversely, the total energy of internal water increases with the cavity size because the absolute number of water molecules increases. For CB7, which has emerged as an ultrahigh affinity binder, these counteracting effects result in a maximum energy gain through a complete removal of water molecules from the cavity. A new design criterion for aqueous synthetic receptors has therefore emerged, which is the optimization of the size of cavities and binding pockets with respect to the energy and number of residing water molecules.},

  abstract = {ConspectusThis Account focuses on stimuli responsive systems that function in aqueous solution using examples drawn from the work of the Isaacs group using cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) molecular containers as key recognition elements. Our entry into the area of stimuli responsive systems began with the preparation of glycoluril derived molecular clips that efficiently distinguish between self and nonself by H-bonds and $\pi$\textendash$\pi$ interactions even within complex mixtures and therefore undergo self-sorting. We concluded that the selectivity of a wide variety of H-bonded supramolecular assemblies was higher than previously appreciated and that self-sorting is not exceptional behavior. This lead us to examine self-sorting within the context of CB[n] host\textendash{}guest chemistry in water.We discovered that CB[n] homologues (CB[7] and CB[8]) display remarkably high binding affinity (Ka up to 1017 M\textendash{}1) and selectivity ($\Delta\Delta$G) toward their guests, which renders CB[n]s prime components for the construction of stimuli responsive host\textendash{}guest systems. The CB[7]$\cdot$adamantaneammonium ion complex, which is particularly privileged (Ka = 4.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M\textendash{}1), was introduced by us as a stimulus to trigger constitutional changes in multicomponent self-sorting systems. For example, we describe how the free energy associated with the formation of host\textendash{}guest complexes of CB[n]-type receptors can drive conformational changes of included guests like triazene\textendash{}arylene foldamers and cationic calix[4]arenes, as well as induced conformational changes (e.g., ammonium guest size dependent homotropic allostery, metal ion triggered folding, and heterochiral dimerization) of the hosts themselves.Many guests display large pKa shifts within their CB[n]\textendash{}guest complexes, which we used to promote pH controlled guest swapping and thermal trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene derivatives. We also used the high affinity and selectivity of CB[7] toward its guests to outcompete an enzyme (bovine carbonic anhydrase) for a two-faced inhibitor, which allowed stimuli responsive regulation of enzymatic activity. These results prompted us to examine the use of CB[n]-type receptors in both in vitro and in vivo biological systems. We demonstrated that adamantaneammonium ion can be used to intracellularly sequester CB[7] from gold nanoparticles passivated with hexanediammonium ion$\cdot$CB[7] complexes and thereby trigger cytotoxicity. CB[7] derivatives bearing a biotin targeting group enhance the cytotoxicity of encapsulated oxaliplatin toward L1210FR cells. Finally, acyclic CB[n]-type receptors function as solubilizing excipients for insoluble drugs for drug delivery purposes and as a broad spectrum reversal agent for the neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium, vecuronium, and cis-atracurium in rats. The work highlights the great potential for integration of CB[n]-type receptors with biological systems.},

The kinetics of the macrocyclization reaction between hexamer and formaldehyde or phthalaldehyde depends on the presence and identity of ammonium ions as templates. p-Xylylenediammonium ion (11) which barely fits inside CB[6] sized cavities acts as a negative template which slows down transformation of 6C and paraformaldehyde into CB[6]. In contrast, 11 and hexanediammonium ion (20) act as a positive template that promotes the macrocyclization reaction between 6C and 12 to deliver ($\pm$)-21 as a key intermediate along the mechanistic pathway to CB[6] derivatives. Naphthalene-CB[6] derivative 19 which contains both fluorophore and ureidyl C═O metal-ion (e.g., Eu3+) binding sites forms the basis for a fluorescence turn-on assay for suitable ammonium ions (e.g., hexanediammonium ion and histamine).},

The inherent solubilities of M2C2 (68\hspace{0.25em}mm) and M2C4 (196\hspace{0.25em}mm) are higher than the analogue with a (CH2)3 linker (M2, 14\hspace{0.25em}mm) studied previously. 1H\hspace{0.25em}NMR dilution experiments show that M2C2 and M2C4 do not self-associate in water, which enables their use as solubilizing excipients. We used phase solubility diagrams (PSDs) to compare the solubilizing capacities of M2, M2C2, M2C4, hydroxypropyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (HP-$\beta$-CD), and sulfobutylether-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (SBE-$\beta$-CD) toward 15 insoluble drugs. We found that M2C2 and M2C4\textemdash{}as gauged by the slope of their PSDs\textemdash{}are less potent solubilizing agents than M2. However, the higher inherent solubility of M2C2 allows higher concentrations of drug to be formulated using M2C2 than with M2 in several cases. The solubilizing ability of M2C2 and SBE-$\beta$-CD were similar in many cases, with Krel values averaging 23 and 12, respectively, relative to HP-$\beta$-CD.

  abstract = {We present the design, synthesis via methylene bridged glycoluril tetramer building blocks, and charaterization of acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners that function as hosts for a wide variety of ammonium ions in water. The X-ray crystallographic characterization of the free host and its complexes with p-xylylenediamine and spermine establish the flexibility of the methylene bridged backbone of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners that allow them to adapt to the structural features of the guest. We find that the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners\rule{1em}{1pt}with their four contiguous methylene bridged glycoluril units and two aromatic o-xylylene walls bearing CO2H substituents\rule{1em}{1pt}bind to ammonium ions in buffered water with values of Ka ranging from $\sim$105 M-1 to greater than 109 M-1. Similar to the cucurbit[n]uril family of hosts, we find that increasing the concentration of metal cations in the buffer reduces the affinity of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congener toward guests by competitive binding at the ureidyl C═O portals. Although the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners retain the ability to bind to ammonium ions with high affinity, they do so with lower selectivity than cucurbit[n]urils presumably do to the structural flexibility of the hosts. A methylene bridged glycoluril tetramer model compound that lacks the substituted o-xylylene walls is a much lower affinity host, which establishes the importance of these rings on the overall recognition behavior of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners. Overall, the results in this paper establish that acyclic cucurbit[n]uril receptors that contain four or more contiguous methylene bridged glycoluril units retain many of the excellent recognition properties of the cucurbit[n]uril family.},

  abstract = {The factors affecting host-guest complexation between the molecular container compound cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and various guests in aqueous solution are studied, and a detailed complexation mechanism in the presence of cations is derived. The formation of the supramolecular complex is studied in detail for cyclohexylmethylammonium ion as guest. The kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation is monitored by NMR as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and cation size. The binding constants and the ingression rate constants decrease with increasing salt concentration and cation-binding constant, in agreement with a competitive binding of the ammonium site of the guest and the metal cation with the ureido carbonyl portals of CB6. Studies as a function of guest size indicate that the effective container volume of the CB6 cavity is approximately 105 {\AA}3. It is suggested that larger guests are excluded for two reasons:\, a high activation barrier for ingression imposed by the tight CB6 portals and a destabilization of the complex due to steric repulsion inside. For example, in the case of the nearly spherical azoalkane homologues 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (DBH, volume ca. 96 {\AA}3) and 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO, volume ca. 110 {\AA}3), the former forms the CB6 complex promptly with a sizable binding constant (1300 M-1), while the latter does not form a complex even after several months at optimized complexation conditions. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed for several CB6/guest complexes. A qualitative agreement is found between experimental and calculated activation energies for ingression as a function of both guest size and state of protonation. The potential role of constrictive binding by CB6 is discussed.},

In these studies, it was possible to separate hydrophobic from dispersive interactions, which are strongest in aqueous systems. Even very hydrophobic alkanes associate significantly only in cavities containing water molecules with an insufficient number of possible hydrogen bonds. The replacement of high-energy water in cavities by guest molecules is the essential enthalpic driving force for complexation, as borne out by data for complexes of cyclodextrins, cyclophanes, and cucurbiturils, for which complexation enthalpies of up to -100\hspace{0.25em}kJ\,mol-1 were reached for encapsulated alkyl residues. Water-box simulations were used to characterize the different contributions from high-energy water and enabled the calculation of the association free enthalpies for selected cucurbituril complexes to within a 10\,\% deviation from experimental values. Cavities in artificial receptors are more apt to show the enthalpic effect of high-energy water than those in proteins or nucleic acids, because they bear fewer or no functional groups in the inner cavity to stabilize interior water molecules.},

  abstract = {Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn) bind guest molecules through a combination of electrostatic interactions with the carbonyl rims and hydrophobic interactions with the inner cavity. Investigations with solvatochromic probes in CB7 reveal that the polarity of the cavity resembles that of alcohols (e.g., n-octanol), while its polarizability (P=0.12) and apparent refractive index (nD=1.10$\pm$0.12) are extremely low, close to the gas phase. The calculated molecular quadrupole moments of CBs are extremely large ($\Theta$zz=-120 to -340 Buckingham). A survey of reported binding constants of neutral guests and hydrophobic residues that form 1\,:\,1 inclusion complexes with CB6, reveals a preferential inclusion of C3\textendash{}C5 residues in its cavity. The largest guests which show non-negligible binding contain 7 heavy atoms (excluding hydrogen). For CB7, the strongest binding is observed for guests with adamantyl (10 heavy atoms) and ferrocenyl groups (11 heavy atoms), while the largest guests known to be complexed are carborane and the adduct of two pyridine derivatives (12 heavy atoms). The evaluation of different volumes shows that the most meaningful cavity, namely that responsible for binding of hydrophobic residues, is confined by the planes through the oxygen carbonyls. The volume of this inner cavity follows the formula V/{\AA}3=68+62(n-5)+12.5(n-5)2, affording representative cavity volumes of 68\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB5, 142\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB6, 242\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB7, and 367\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB8. The volume of the 2 bond dipole regions is comparably smaller, amounting, for example, to 2\texttimes{}35\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB6. The analysis of packing coefficients for representative sets of known guests with clearly defined hydrophobic binding motifs reveals average values of 47\,\% for CB5, 58\,\% for CB6, 52\,\% for CB7, and 53\,\% for CB8, which are well in line with the preferred packing (``55\,\% solution'', see S. Mecozzi, J. Rebek, Chem. Eur. J.1998, 4, 1016\textendash{}1022) in related supramolecular host\textendash{}guest assemblies. The driving force for binding of hydrophobic guests and residues by CBs is interpreted in terms of the unimportance of dispersion interactions (owing to the low polarizability of their cavity) and the dominance of classical and nonclassical hydrophobic effects related to the removal of very-high-energy water molecules (2 for CB5, 4 for CB6, 8 for CB7, and 12 for CB8) from the cavity.},

Cucurbiturils, in particular, stand out in that they do not only provide a hydrophobic cavity to encapsulate the drug in the form of a host\textendash{}guest complex, but in that they possess cation-receptor properties, which favor the encapsulation of protonated drugs over their unprotonated forms, resulting in pronounced pKa shifts up to 5 units. These pKa shifts can be rationally exploited to activate prodrug molecules, to stabilize the active form of drug molecules, to enhance their solubility, and to increase their degree of ionization, factors which can jointly serve to enhance the bioavailability of drugs, particularly weakly basic ones. Additionally, macrocycles can serve to increase the chemical stability of drugs by protecting them against reactions with nucleophiles (e.g., thiols) and electrophiles, by increasing their photostability, and by causing a higher thermal stability in the solid state. Detailed examples of the different effects of macrocyclic encapsulation of drugs and the associated pKa shifts are provided and discussed. Other important considerations, namely a potential lowering of the bioactivity of drugs by macrocyclic complexation, interferences of the macrocycles with biocatalytic processes, the toxicity of the macrocyclic host molecules, and problems and opportunities related to a targeted release and the rate of release of the drug from the host\textendash{}guest complexes are critically evaluated.},

Electrostatic effects play a dominant role in the recognition process whereby ion\textendash{}dipole interactions may occur between ammonium ions and the C=O groups of 1, between the SO3- groups of 1 and pendant cationic groups on the guest, and within the cavity of 1 by cation\textendash$\pi$ interactions. Host 1 displays a high affinity toward dicationic guests with large planar aromatic surfaces (e.g. naphthalene diimide NDI+ and perylene diimide PDI+) and cationic dyes derived from acridine (e.g. methylene blue and azure\hspace{0.25em}A). The critical importance of cation\textendash$\pi$ interactions was ascertained by a comparison of analogous neutral and cationic guests (e.g. methylene violet vs. methylene blue; quinoline vs. N-methylquinolinium; acridine vs. N-methylacridinium; neutral red vs. neutral red H+) the affinities of which differ by up to 380-fold. We demonstrate that the high affinity of 1 toward methylene blue (Ka=3.92\texttimes{}107\,m-1; Kd=25\hspace{0.25em}nm) allows for the selective sequestration and destaining of U87 cells stained with methylene blue.},

  abstract = {The recognition properties of acyclic cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) congener 1 towards seven local anaesthetic drugs (2\textendash{}8) are reported. Job plots constructed from 1H NMR experiments confirm the 1:1 host:guest nature of these complexes, whereas the changes in chemical shift observed upon complex formation ($\Delta\delta$ values) provide information about the geometry of the host\textendash{}guest complexes. For complexes between host 1 and guests 2\textendash{}5 and 8, a single geometry was preferred, whereas for guests 6 and 7 a mixture of two diastereomeric complexes was indicated. The K a values for complexes between 1 and 2\textendash{}8 fall in the range of 103\textendash{}108 M- 1 as determined by UV\textendash{}vis and 1H NMR competition experiments. The results further establish that acyclic CB[n]-type receptor 1 is preorganised into the C-shape required for binding and that its aromatic o-xylylene walls endow it with a potency towards aromatic ammonium ions. The K a values reported in this paper constitute a blind data-set used in the SAMPL3 challenge aimed at testing computational methods relevant to protein$\surd$ligand systems. The work thus highlights the great potential of CB[n] receptors as model systems to promote synergy between the supramolecular and computational chemistry communities.},

  abstract = {We describe binding free energy calculations in the D3R Grand Challenge 2015 for blind prediction of the binding affinities of 180 ligands to Hsp90. The present D3R challenge was built around experimental datasets involving Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90, an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone which is an important anticancer drug target. The Hsp90 ATP binding site is known to be a challenging target for accurate calculations of ligand binding affinities because of the ligand-dependent conformational changes in the binding site, the presence of ordered waters and the broad chemical diversity of ligands that can bind at this site. Our primary focus here is to distinguish binders from nonbinders. Large scale absolute binding free energy calculations that cover over 3000 protein\textendash{}ligand complexes were performed using the BEDAM method starting from docked structures generated by Glide docking. Although the ligand dataset in this study resembles an intermediate to late stage lead optimization project while the BEDAM method is mainly developed for early stage virtual screening of hit molecules, the BEDAM binding free energy scoring has resulted in a moderate enrichment of ligand screening against this challenging drug target. Results show that, using a statistical mechanics based free energy method like BEDAM starting from docked poses offers better enrichment than classical docking scoring functions and rescoring methods like Prime MM-GBSA for the Hsp90 data set in this blind challenge. Importantly, among the three methods tested here, only the mean value of the BEDAM binding free energy scores is able to separate the large group of binders from the small group of nonbinders with a gap of 2.4 kcal/mol. None of the three methods that we have tested provided accurate ranking of the affinities of the 147 active compounds. We discuss the possible sources of errors in the binding free energy calculations. The study suggests that BEDAM can be used strategically to discriminate binders from nonbinders in virtual screening and to more accurately predict the ligand binding modes prior to the more computationally expensive FEP calculations of binding affinity.},

  abstract = {We have estimated the binding affinity of three sets of ligands of the heat-shock protein 90 in the D3R grand challenge blind test competition. We have employed four different methods, based on five different crystal structures: first, we docked the ligands to the proteins with induced-fit docking with the Glide software and calculated binding affinities with three energy functions. Second, the docked structures were minimised in a continuum solvent and binding affinities were calculated with the MM/GBSA method (molecular mechanics combined with generalised Born and solvent-accessible surface area solvation). Third, the docked structures were re-optimised by combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Then, interaction energies were calculated with quantum mechanical calculations employing 970\textendash{}1160 atoms in a continuum solvent, combined with energy corrections for dispersion, zero-point energy and entropy, ligand distortion, ligand solvation, and an increase of the basis set to quadruple-zeta quality. Fourth, relative binding affinities were estimated by free-energy simulations, using the multi-state Bennett acceptance-ratio approach. Unfortunately, the results were varying and rather poor, with only one calculation giving a correlation to the experimental affinities larger than 0.7, and with no consistent difference in the quality of the predictions from the various methods. For one set of ligands, the results could be strongly improved (after experimental data were revealed) if it was recognised that one of the ligands displaced one or two water molecules. For the other two sets, the problem is probably that the ligands bind in different modes than in the crystal structures employed or that the conformation of the ligand-binding site or the whole protein changes.},

Rather than explicitly using structural data such as affinity values or information extracted from crystal binding poses for training, we instead exploit the abundance of data available from high-throughput screening to approach the problem as one of discriminating binders from non-binders. We evaluate the performance of our various scoring methods in the 2015 D3R Grand Challenge and find that although the merits of some features of our approach remain inconclusive, our scoring methods performed comparably to a state-of-the-art scoring function that was fit to binding affinity data.},

  abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein\textendash{}ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host\textendash{}guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host\textendash{}guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of SAMPL prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present SAMPL5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the SAMPL challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host\textendash{}guest component of SAMPL5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior SAMPL rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

Intramolecular interactions are by far the most common manifestation of this effect, which offers a means of modulating the conformational preferences of a molecule. Although a well-documented phenomenon, a priori applications in drug design are relatively sparse and this interaction, which is often isosteric with an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction, appears to be underappreciated by the medicinal chemistry community. In this Perspective, we discuss the theoretical basis for sulfur $\sigma$* orbital interactions and illustrate their importance in the context of drug design and organic synthesis. The role of sulfur interactions in protein structure and function is discussed and although relatively rare, intermolecular interactions between ligand C\textendash{}S $\sigma$* orbitals and proteins are illustrated.},

  abstract = {In the recent SAMPL5 challenge, participants submitted predictions for cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 small molecules. Distribution coefficients (log D) replace the hydration free energies that were a central part of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of computational methods were represented by the 76 submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics and provide details for a number of reference calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4 challenge, we assessed the ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty, but their model uncertainty\textemdash{}how well they can predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around 1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge provided great insight into the importance of modeling a variety of physical effects. We believe these types of measurements will be a promising source of data for future blind challenges, especially in view of the relatively straightforward nature of the experiments and the level of insight provided.},

  abstract = {The 1-octanol\textendash{}water partition coefficient log Kow of a solute is a key parameter used in the prediction of a wide variety of complex phenomena such as drug availability and bioaccumulation potential of trace contaminants. In this work, adaptive biasing force molecular dynamics simulations are used to determine absolute free energies of hydration, solvation, and 1-octanol\textendash{}water partition coefficients for n-alkanes from methane to octane. Two approaches are evaluated; the direct transfer of the solute from 1-octanol to water phase, and separate transfers of the solute from the water or 1-octanol phase to vacuum, with both methods yielding statistically indistinguishable results. Calculations performed with the TIP4P and SPC/E water models and the TraPPE united-atom force field for n-alkanes show that the choice of water model has a negligible effect on predicted free energies of transfer and partition coefficients for n-alkanes. A comparison of calculations using wet and dry octanol phases shows that the predictions for log Kow using wet octanol are 0.2\textendash{}0.4 log units lower than for dry octanol, although this is within the statistical uncertainty of the calculation.},

Many kinase inhibitors\textemdash{}including the cancer drug imatinib\textemdash{}selectively target a specific DFG conformation, but the function and mechanism of the flip remain unclear. Using long molecular dynamics simulations of the Abl kinase, we visualized the DFG flip in atomic-level detail and formulated an energetic model predicting that protonation of the DFG aspartate controls the flip. Consistent with our model's predictions, we demonstrated experimentally that the kinetics of imatinib binding to Abl kinase have a pH dependence that disappears when the DFG aspartate is mutated. Our model suggests a possible explanation for the high degree of conservation of the DFG motif: that the flip, modulated by electrostatic changes inherent to the catalytic cycle, allows the kinase to access flexible conformations facilitating nucleotide binding and release.},

  abstract = {Human serum albumin possesses multiple binding sites and transports a wide range of ligands that include the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of this protein in accommodating small ligands. In this work, we provide a set of predictions covering the geometry, affinity of binding and protonation state for the pharmaceutically most active form (S-isomer) of ibuprofen to albumin, by using absolute binding free energy calculations in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The most favorable binding modes correctly reproduce several experimentally identified binding locations, which include the two Sudlow's drug sites (DS2 and DS1) and the fatty acid binding sites 6 and 2 (FA6 and FA2). Previously unknown details of the binding conformations were revealed for some of them, and formerly undetected binding modes were found in other protein sites. The calculated binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form. These findings provide a detailed description of the binding of ibuprofen, help to explain a wide range of results reported in the literature in the last decades, and demonstrate the possibility of using simulation methods to predict ligand binding to albumin.},

Using this strategy, we determine simple and transferable hydroxyl modulation rules that, when applied to an existing molecular parameter set, result in a newly dielectric corrected (DC) parameter set. We applied these rules to the general Amber force field (GAFF) to form an initial set of GAFF-DC parameters, and we found this to lead to significant improvement in the calculated dielectric constant and hydration free energy values for a wide variety of small molecule alcohol models. Tests of the GAFF-DC parameters in the SAMPL4 blind prediction event for hydration show these changes improve agreement with experiment. Surprisingly, these simple modifications also outperform detailed quantum mechanical electric field calculations using a self-consistent reaction field environment coupling term. This work provides a potential benchmark for future developments in methods for representing condensed-phase environments in electronic structure calculations.},

The Cooperative brings together laboratories with expertise and interest in theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of protein electrostatics. To improve structure-based energy calculations, it is necessary to better understand the physical character and molecular determinants of electrostatic effects. Thus, the Cooperative intends to foment experimental research into fundamental aspects of proteins that depend on electrostatic interactions. It will maintain a depository for experimental data useful for critical assessment of methods for structure-based electrostatics calculations. To help guide the development of computational methods, the Cooperative will organize blind prediction exercises. As a first step, computational laboratories were invited to reproduce an unpublished set of experimental pKa values of acidic and basic residues introduced in the interior of staphylococcal nuclease by site-directed mutagenesis. The pKa values of these groups are unique and challenging to simulate owing to the large magnitude of their shifts relative to normal pKa values in water. Many computational methods were tested in this first Blind Prediction Challenge and critical assessment exercise. A workshop was organized in the Telluride Science Research Center to objectively assess the performance of many computational methods tested on this one extensive data set. This volume of Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics introduces the pKa Cooperative, presents reports submitted by participants in the Blind Prediction Challenge, and highlights some of the problems in structure-based calculations identified during this exercise.

In four years, 17 complexes offered by crystallographers as targets prior to publication, have been subjected to structure prediction by docking their two components. Models of these complexes were submitted by predictor groups and assessed by comparing their geometry to the X-ray structure and by evaluating the quality of the prediction of the regions of interaction and of the pair wise residue contacts. Prediction was successful on 12 of the 17 targets, most of the failures being due to large conformation changes that the algorithms could not cope with. Progress in the prediction quality observed in four years indicates that the experiment is a powerful incentive to develop new procedures that allow for flexibility during docking and incorporate nonstructural information. We therefore call upon structural biologists who study protein\textendash{}protein complexes to provide targets for further rounds of CAPRI predictions.},

The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 CASP experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature of CASP targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.

  abstract = {Passive or unassisted ion permeation through lipid bilayers involves a type of rare events by which cells regulate their salt concentrations and pH. It is important to understand its mechanism in order to develop technologies of, for example, delivering or maintaining small drug-like molecules inside cells. In earlier simulations of passive ion permeations, the commonly used sampling methods usually define the positions of ions relative to the membrane as a measure of permeation, i.e., the collective variable, ignoring the active participations of other particles. Newly defined collective variables involving the movements of ions, lipids, and water molecules allow us to identify the transition paths on the free energy landscape using the 2D umbrella sampling techniques. In this work, this technique was used to study the permeation processes of some well-known ions, sodium, potassium, and chloride. It is found permeations of sodium and potassium are assisted by important lipid bilayer deformations and massive water solvation, while chloride may not. Chloride may have two different possible pathways, in which the energetic favorable one is similar to the solubility-diffusion model. The free energy barriers for the permeation of these ions are in semiquantitative agreement with experiments. Further analyses on the distributions of oxygens and interaction energies suggest the electrostatic interactions between ions and polar headgroups of lipids may greatly influence membrane deformation as well as the water wire and furthermore the free energy barriers of waterwire mediated pathways. For chloride, the nonwaterwire pathway may be energetically favorable.},

Initial conformations of CBClip complexes were obtained using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations were performed using thermodynamic integration (TI) with soft-core potentials and Bennett's acceptance ratio (BAR) method based on a serial insertion scheme. We compared the results obtained with TI simulations with soft-core potentials and Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations with the serial insertion method combined with the BAR method. The results show that the difference between the two methods can be mainly attributed to the van der Waals free energies, suggesting that either the simulations used for TI or the simulations used for BAR, or both are not fully converged and the two sets of simulations may have sampled difference phase space regions. The penalty scores of force field parameters of the 10 guest molecules provided by CHARMM Generalized Force Field can be an indicator of the accuracy of binding free energy calculations. Among our submissions, the combination of docking and TI performed best, which yielded the root mean square deviation of 2.94 kcal/mol and an average unsigned error of 3.41 kcal/mol for the ten guest molecules. These values were best overall among all participants. However, our submissions had little correlation with experiments.},

We present a protocol for accurately predicting partition coefficients between two immiscible phases, and then apply it to 53 drug-like molecules in the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge. Our results combine implicit solvent QM calculations with classical MD simulations using the non-Boltzmann Bennett free energy estimator. The OLYP/DZP/SMD method yields predictions that have a small deviation from experiment (RMSD = 2.3 loglog$\backslash$log D units), relative to other participants in the challenge. Our free energy corrections based on QM protomer and pKapKa\{$\backslash$text\{p\}\}K\_\{$\backslash$text\{a\}\} calculations increase the correlation between predicted and experimental distribution coefficients, for all methods used. Unfortunately, these corrections are overly hydrophilic, and fail to account for additional effects such as aggregation, water dragging and the presence of polar impurities in the apolar phase. We show that, although expensive, QM-NBB free energy calculations offer an accurate and robust method that is superior to standard MM and QM techniques alone.},

In this approach, the ligand is pulled out of the binding cavity of the protein using external harmonic forces, and the work of pulling force corresponds to the relative binding affinity of HIV-1 PR inhibitor. The correlation coefficient between the pulling work and the experimental binding free energy of 
R=-0.95 shows that FPL results are in good agreement with experiment. It is thus easier to rank the binding affinities of HIV-1 PR inhibitors, that have similar binding affinities because the mean error bar of pulling work amounts to
$\delta$W=7\%. The nature of binding is discovered using the FPL approach. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Because LDA-ITER attempts to determine a projection such that the projections of the two trajectories do not overlap, the comparison does not suffer from a strong anisotropy, which is an issue in protein dynamics. LDA-ITER is applied to two test cases: the T4 lysozyme protein simulation with or without a point mutation and the allosteric protein PDZ2 domain of hPTP1E with or without a ligand. The projection determined by the method agrees with the experimental data and previous simulations. The proposed procedure, which complements existing methods, is a versatile analytical method that is specialized to find the ``difference'' between two trajectories.},

Here the performance of the AMOEBA polarizable force field is evaluated under nonaqueous conditions by calculating the solvation free energies of small molecules in four common organic solvents. Results are compared with experimental data and equivalent simulations performed with the GAFF pairwise-additive force field. Although AMOEBA results give mean errors close to ``chemical accuracy,'' GAFF performs surprisingly well, with statistically significantly more accurate results than AMOEBA in some solvents. However, for both models, free energies calculated in chloroform show worst agreement to experiment and individual solutes are consistently poor performers, suggesting non-potential-specific errors also contribute to inaccuracy. Scope for the improvement of both potentials remains limited by the lack of high quality experimental data across multiple solvents, particularly those of high dielectric constant. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Proteins commonly sample a number of conformational states to carry out their biological function, often requiring transitions from the ground state to higher-energy states. Characterizing the mechanisms that guide these transitions at the atomic level promises to impact our understanding of functional protein dynamics and energy landscapes. The leucine-99-to-alanine (L99A) mutant of T4 lysozyme is a model system that has an experimentally well characterized excited sparsely populated state as well as a ground state. Despite the exhaustive study of L99A protein dynamics, the conformational changes that permit transitioning to the experimentally detected excited state ($\sim$3\%, $\Delta$G $\sim$2~kcal/mol) remain unclear. Here, we describe the transitions from the ground state to this sparsely populated excited state of L99A as observed through a single molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory on the Anton supercomputer. Aside from detailing the ground-to-excited-state transition, the trajectory samples multiple metastates and an intermediate state en route to the excited state. Dynamic motions between these states enable cavity surface openings large enough to admit benzene on timescales congruent with known rates for benzene binding. Thus, these fluctuations between rare protein states provide an atomic description of the concerted motions that illuminate potential path(s) for ligand binding. These results reveal, to our knowledge, a new level of complexity in the dynamics of buried cavities and their role in creating mobile defects that affect protein dynamics and ligand binding.},

  abstract = {In order to increase the accuracy of classical computer simulations, existing methodologies may need to be adapted. Hitherto, most force fields employ a truncated potential function to model van der Waals interactions, sometimes augmented with an analytical correction. Although such corrections are accurate for homogeneous systems with a long cutoff, they should not be used in inherently inhomogeneous systems such as biomolecular and interface systems. For such cases, a variant of the particle mesh Ewald algorithm (Lennard-Jones PME) was already proposed 20 years ago (Essmann et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1995, 103, 8577\textendash{}8593), but it was implemented only recently (Wennberg et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 3527\textendash{}3537) in a major simulation code (GROMACS). The availability of this method allows surface tensions of liquids as well as bulk properties to be established, such as density and enthalpy of vaporization, without approximations due to truncation. Here, we report on simulations of $\approx$150 liquids (taken from a force field benchmark: Caleman et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012, 8, 61\textendash{}74) using three different force fields and compare simulations with and without explicit long-range van der Waals interactions. We find that the density and enthalpy of vaporization increase for most liquids using the generalized Amber force field (GAFF, Wang et al. J. Comput. Chem. 2004, 25, 1157\textendash{}1174) and the Charmm generalized force field (CGenFF, Vanommeslaeghe et al. J. Comput. Chem. 2010, 31, 671\textendash{}690) but less so for OPLS/AA (Jorgensen and Tirado-Rives, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005, 102, 6665\textendash{}6670), which was parametrized with an analytical correction to the van der Waals potential. The surface tension increases by $\approx$10\textendash{}2 N/m for all force fields. These results suggest that van der Waals attractions in force fields are too strong, in particular for the GAFF and CGenFF. In addition to the simulation results, we introduce a new version of a web server, http://virtualchemistry.org, aimed at facilitating sharing and reuse of input files for molecular simulations.},

In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and fully transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI in short. ANI is a new method and procedure for training neural network potentials that utilizes a highly modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors as a molecular representation. We utilize ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also propose a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular configurations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set, with root mean square errors as low as 0.56 kcal/mol.},

  abstract = {Human serum albumin possesses multiple binding sites and transports a wide range of ligands that include the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of this protein in accommodating small ligands. In this work, we provide a set of predictions covering the geometry, affinity of binding and protonation state for the pharmaceutically most active form (S-isomer) of ibuprofen to albumin, by using absolute binding free energy calculations in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The most favorable binding modes correctly reproduce several experimentally identified binding locations, which include the two Sudlow's drug sites (DS2 and DS1) and the fatty acid binding sites 6 and 2 (FA6 and FA2). Previously unknown details of the binding conformations were revealed for some of them, and formerly undetected binding modes were found in other protein sites. The calculated binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form. These findings provide a detailed description of the binding of ibuprofen, help to explain a wide range of results reported in the literature in the last decades, and demonstrate the possibility of using simulation methods to predict ligand binding to albumin.},

Two targets served as the framework to test community docking and scoring methods: (1) HSP90, donated by AbbVie and the Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR), and (2) MAP4K4, donated by Genentech. The challenges for both target datasets were conducted in two stages, with the first stage testing pose predictions and the capacity to rank compounds by affinity with minimal structural data; and the second stage testing methods for ranking compounds with knowledge of at least a subset of the ligand\textendash{}protein poses. An additional sub-challenge provided small groups of chemically similar HSP90 compounds amenable to alchemical calculations of relative binding free energy. Unlike previous blinded Challenges, we did not provide cognate receptors or receptors prepared with hydrogens and likewise did not require a specified crystal structure to be used for pose or affinity prediction in Stage 1. Given the freedom to select from over 200 crystal structures of HSP90 in the PDB, participants employed workflows that tested not only core docking and scoring technologies, but also methods for addressing water-mediated ligand\textendash{}protein interactions, binding pocket flexibility, and the optimal selection of protein structures for use in docking calculations. Nearly 40 participating groups submitted over 350 prediction sets for Grand Challenge 2015.

Recent advances in sampling methods and force fields coupled with vast increases in computational resources have made FEP a viable technology to drive hit-to-lead and lead optimization, allowing for more efficient cycles of medicinal chemistry and the possibility to explore much larger chemical spaces. However, previous FEP applications have focused on systems with high-resolution crystal structures of the target as starting points\textemdash{}something that is not always available in drug discovery projects. As such, the ability to apply FEP on homology models would greatly expand the domain of applicability of FEP in drug discovery. In this work we apply a particular implementation of FEP, called FEP+, on congeneric ligand series binding to four diverse targets: a kinase (Tyk2), an epigenetic bromodomain (BRD4), a transmembrane GPCR (A2A), and a protein\textendash{}protein interaction interface (BCL-2 family protein MCL-1). We apply FEP+ using both crystal structures and homology models as starting points and find that the performance using homology models is generally on a par with the results when using crystal structures. The robustness of the calculations to structural variations in the input models can likely be attributed to the conformational sampling in the molecular dynamics simulations, which allows the modeled receptor to adapt to the ``real'' conformation for each ligand in the series. This work exemplifies the advantages of using all-atom simulation methods with full system flexibility and offers promise for the general application of FEP to homology models, although additional validation studies should be performed to further understand the limitations of the method and the scenarios where FEP will work best.},

  abstract = {The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies remains a significant challenge of central importance in computational biophysics and structure-based drug design. Multiple recent advances including the development of greatly improved protein and ligand molecular mechanics force fields, more efficient enhanced sampling methods, and low-cost powerful GPU computing clusters have enabled accurate and reliable predictions of relative protein-ligand binding free energies through the free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. However, the existing FEP methods can only be used to calculate the relative binding free energies for R-group modifications or single-atom modifications, and cannot be used to efficiently evaluate scaffold hopping modifications to a lead molecule. Scaffold hopping or core hopping, a very common design strategy in drug discovery projects, is not only critical in the early stages of a discovery campaign where novel active matter must be identified, but also in lead optimization where the resolution of a variety of ADME/Tox problems may require identification of a novel core structure. In this paper, we introduce a method that enables theoretically rigorous, yet computationally tractable, relative protein-ligand binding free energy calculations to be pursued for scaffold hopping modifications. We apply the method to six pharmaceutically interesting cases where diverse types of scaffold hopping modifications were required to identify the drug molecules ultimately sent into the clinic. For these six diverse cases, the predicted binding affinities were in close agreement with experiment, demonstrating the wide applicability and the significant impact Core Hopping FEP may provide in drug discovery projects.},

  abstract = {The factors affecting host-guest complexation between the molecular container compound cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and various guests in aqueous solution are studied, and a detailed complexation mechanism in the presence of cations is derived. The formation of the supramolecular complex is studied in detail for cyclohexylmethylammonium ion as guest. The kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation is monitored by NMR as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and cation size. The binding constants and the ingression rate constants decrease with increasing salt concentration and cation-binding constant, in agreement with a competitive binding of the ammonium site of the guest and the metal cation with the ureido carbonyl portals of CB6. Studies as a function of guest size indicate that the effective container volume of the CB6 cavity is approximately 105 {\AA}3. It is suggested that larger guests are excluded for two reasons:\, a high activation barrier for ingression imposed by the tight CB6 portals and a destabilization of the complex due to steric repulsion inside. For example, in the case of the nearly spherical azoalkane homologues 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (DBH, volume ca. 96 {\AA}3) and 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO, volume ca. 110 {\AA}3), the former forms the CB6 complex promptly with a sizable binding constant (1300 M-1), while the latter does not form a complex even after several months at optimized complexation conditions. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed for several CB6/guest complexes. A qualitative agreement is found between experimental and calculated activation energies for ingression as a function of both guest size and state of protonation. The potential role of constrictive binding by CB6 is discussed.},

  abstract = {The activated state of cytochrome c peroxidase, compound ES, contains a cation radical on the Trp-191 side chain. We recently reported that replacing this tryptophan with glycine creates a buried cavity at the active site that contains ordered solvent and that will specifically bind substituted imidazoles in their protonated cationic forms (Fitzgerald MM, Churchill MJ, McRee DE, Goodin DB, 1994, Biochemistry 55:3807\textendash{}3818). Proposals that a nearby carboxylate, Asp-235, and competing monovalent cations should modulate the affinity of the W191G cavity for ligand binding are addressed in this study. Competitive binding titrations of the imidazolium ion to W191G as a function of [K+] show that potassium competes weakly with the binding of imidazoles. The dissociation constant observed for potassium binding (18 mM) is more than 3, 000-fold higher than that for 1, 2-dimethylimidazole (5.5 $\mu$M) in the absence of competing cations. Significantly, the W191G-D235N double mutant shows no evidence for binding imidazoles in their cationic or neutral forms, even though the structure of the cavity remains largely unperturbed by replacement of the carboxylate. Refined crystallographic 5-values of solvent positions indicate that the weakly bound potassium in W191G is significantly depopulated in the double mutant. These results demonstrate that the buried negative charge of Asp-235 is an essential feature of the cation binding determinant and indicate that this carboxylate plays a critical role in stabilizing the formation of the Trp-191 radical cation.},

  abstract = {The binding of a series of low molecular weight ligands towards trypsin and thrombin has been studied by isothermal titration calorimetry and protein crystallography. In a series of congeneric ligands, surprising changes of protonation states occur and are overlaid on the binding process. They result from induced pKa shifts depending on the local environment experienced by the ligand and protein functional groups in the complex (induced dielectric fit). They involve additional heat effects that must be corrected before any conclusion on the binding enthalpy ($\Delta$H) and entropy ($\Delta$S) can be drawn. After correction, trends in both contributions can be interpreted in structural terms with respect to the hydrogen bond inventory or residual ligand motions. For all inhibitors studied, a strong negative heat capacity change ($\Delta$Cp) is detected, thus binding becomes more exothermic and entropically less favourable with increasing temperature. Due to a mutual compensation, Gibbs free energy remains virtually unchanged. The strong negative $\Delta$Cp value cannot solely be explained by the removal of hydrophobic surface portions of the protein or ligand from water exposure. Additional contributions must be considered, presumably arising from modulations of the local water structure, changes in vibrational modes or other ordering parameters. For thrombin, smaller negative $\Delta$Cp values are observed for ligand binding in the presence of sodium ions compared to the other alkali ions, probably due to stabilising effects on the protein or changes in the bound water structure.},

So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic `writers' and `erasers'. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein\textendash{}protein interactions of epigenetic `readers', and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation have a profound role in normal development and disease processes. An integral part of this mechanism occurs through lysine acetylation of histone tails which are recognized by bromodomains. While the biological and structural characterization of many bromodomain containing proteins has advanced considerably, the therapeutic tractability of this protein family is only now becoming understood. This paper describes the discovery and molecular characterization of potent (nM) small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the function of the BET family of bromodomains (Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4). By using a combination of phenotypic screening, chemoproteomics, and biophysical studies, we have discovered that the protein\textendash{}protein interactions between bromodomains and acetylated histones can be antagonized by selective small molecules that bind at the acetylated lysine recognition pocket. X-ray crystal structures of compounds bound into bromodomains of Brd2 and Brd4 elucidate the molecular interactions of binding and explain the precisely defined stereochemistry required for activity.},

These compounds have enabled linking of the BET bromodomains with diseases, including cancer and inflammation, suggesting that bromodomains are druggable targets.

Here, we report our structure-guided development of diazobenzene-based small-molecule inhibitors for the BRD4 bromodomains that have over 90\% sequence identity at the acetyl-lysine binding site. Our lead compound, MS436, through a set of water-mediated interactions, exhibits low nanomolar affinity (estimated Ki of 30\textendash{}50 nM), with preference for the first bromodomain over the second. We demonstrated that MS436 effectively inhibits BRD4 activity in NF-$\kappa$B-directed production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in murine macrophages.

  abstract = {Since the $\beta$-cyclodextrin cavity is not a smooth cone but has constrictions in the neighborhoods of the H3 and H5 atoms, the hypothesis that bulky hydrophobic guests can form two isomeric inclusion complexes (one of them, cp, is formed by the entrance of the guest by the primary side of the cavity, and the other one, cs, results from the entrance by the secondary side) is checked. Thus, the inclusion processes of two 1-substituted adamantyl derivatives (rimantidine and adamantylmethanol) with $\beta$-cyclodextrin and its two monoamino derivatives at positions 6 (6-NH2$\beta$-CD) and 3 (3-NH2$\beta$-CD) were studied. From rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments, it was deduced that both guests form cs complexes with $\beta$-CD and 6-NH2$\beta$-CD but cp complexes with 3-NH2$\beta$-CD. In all cases, the hydrophilic group attached to the adamantyl residue protrudes toward the bulk solvent outside the cyclodextrin cavity. The thermodynamic parameters (free energy, equilibrium constant, enthalpy, and entropy) associated with the inclusion phenomena were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments. From these results, the difference in the free energy for the formation of the two complexes, cs and cp, for the same host/guest system has been estimated as being 11.5 $\pm$ 0.8 kJ mol-1. This large difference explains why under normal experimental conditions only one of the two complexes (cs) is detected. It is also concluded that a hyperboloid of revolution can be a better schematic picture to represent the actual geometry of the cyclodextrin cavities than the usual smooth cone or trapezium.},

  abstract = {Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to characterize inclusion complex formation of natural cyclodextrins ($\alpha$- and $\beta$-cyclodextrin) with three drugs ((+)brompheniramine, ($\pm$)brompheniramine, cyclopentolate) in aqueous solutions. ITC measurements were carried out at 298.15 K on a Microcal OMEGA ultrasensitive titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). The experimental data were analyzed on the basis of the model of a single set of identical sites (ITC tutorial guide). $\beta$-CD forms inclusion complexes of stoichiometry 1:1 with the all investigated drugs. In turn, smaller molecule of $\alpha$-CD forms inclusion complexes of two different stoichiometry: with bigger molecules ((+)brompheniramine and ($\pm$)brompheniramine) of a stoichiometry 2:1 and with smaller molecules (cyclopentolate) of a stoichiometry 1:2. Based on the experimental values of equilibrium constant (K) and enthalpy of complex formation ($\Delta$H), the Gibbs energy of complex formation ($\Delta$G), and the entropy of complex formation ($\Delta$S), have been calculated, for all the investigated systems. Obtained results showed that complex formation of $\beta$-CD (bigger molecule with wider cavity compared to $\beta$-CD) with both (+)brompheniramine, ($\pm$)brompheniramine, and cyclopentolate is enthalpy driven while complexes of $\alpha$-CD with the all investigated drugs are enthalpy-entropy stabilized. This indicated that the difference in the cavity dimensions is reflecting in different driving forces of complex formation and binding modes what resulted in different stoichiometry of the obtained inclusion complexes.},

  doi = {10.1038/sj.bjp.0706973},
  abstract = {Background and purpose:
Neuroactive steroids are potent modulators of GABAA receptors and are thus of interest for their sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and anaesthetic properties. Cyclodextrins may be useful tools to manipulate neuroactive effects of steroids on GABAA receptors because cyclodextrins form inclusion complexes with at least some steroids that are active at the GABAA receptor, such as (3$\alpha$,5$\alpha$)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (3$\alpha$5$\alpha$P, allopregnanolone).
Experimental approach:
To assess the versatility of cyclodextrins as steroid modulators, we investigated interactions between $\gamma$-cyclodextrin and neuroactive steroids of different structural classes.
Key results:
Both a bioassay based on electrophysiological assessment of GABAA receptor function and optical measurements of cellular accumulation of a fluorescent steroid analogue suggest that $\gamma$-cyclodextrin sequesters steroids rather than directly influencing GABAA receptor function. Neither a 5$\beta$-reduced A/B ring fusion nor a sulphate group at carbon 3 affected the presumed inclusion complex formation between steroid and $\gamma$-cyclodextrin. Apparent dissociation constants for interactions between natural steroids and $\gamma$-cyclodexrin ranged from 10-60 $\mu$M. Although $\gamma$-cyclodextrin accommodates a range of natural and synthetic steroids, C11 substitutions reduced inclusion complex formation. Using $\gamma$-cyclodextrin to remove steroid not directly bound to GABAA receptors, we found that cellular retention of receptor-unbound steroid rate limits potentiation by 3$\alpha$- hydroxysteroids but not inhibition by sulphated steroids.
Conclusions and implications:
We conclude that $\gamma$-cyclodextrins can be useful, albeit non-specific, tools for terminating the actions of multiple classes of naturally occurring neuroactive steroids.British Journal of Pharmacology (2007) 150, 164\textendash{}175. doi:10.1038/sj.bjp.0706973},

  abstract = {Complexation of sertaconazole (SN) with hydroxypropyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (HP-$\beta$-CD) was characterized by phase-solubility diagram measurements and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) in aqueous medium, and by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry in solid state. The strongest interaction was observed at pH 1.2, at which two different 1:1 complexes can be formed depending on the hydrophobic ring of the drug involved in the process. At pH 5.8 and 7.4 the likelihood of 1:2 stoichiometry increases as a consequence of the simultaneous complexation of the nonprotonized imidazolyl and the dichlorophenyl groups. In the presence of 20\% HP-$\beta$-CD, SN solubility is enhanced by a factor of 116, 107, and 5 at pH 1.2, 5.8, and 7.4, respectively. Complexation enthalpy recorded by ITC showed the same tendency which confirms the practical interest of this technique for fast screening of the potential of CDs as drug solubilizers. Solubility and dissolution rate of the drug from compacts prepared with freeze-dried complexes were significantly greater than those obtained with SN powder or compacts made with physical blends. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 95: 1751\textendash{}1762, 2006},

Elemental analysis, 1H NMR, MS, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis were used to determine the average degree of substitution for each $\beta$-cyclodextrin derivative. The average degrees of substitution are 3.4, 1.6 and 2.5 for sulfoethyl, sulfopropyl and sulfobutyl ether $\beta$-cyclodextrin, respectively. The water solubility of these derivatives is substantially higher than that of $\beta$-cyclodextrin. 1H NMR indicates thatsulfoethyl ether $\beta$-cyclodextrin may have major substitution on the secondaryhydroxyl group while the major substitution in sulfopropyl and sulfobutyl ether$\beta$-cyclodextrin could be on the primary hydroxyl group.

The binding free energies are calculated using conventional mutation of the substrate force field from one chemical structure to another (two-state problem) in water and in the neutral inclusion complex. For calculation of activation free-energy differences between two substrates the transition states are represented by linear combinations of reactant (anionic inclusion complexes) and product (tetrahedral intermediate) force fields (four-state problem). The coefficients of this linear combination are obtained from empirical valence bond simulations of a reference substrate. The calculated relative binding and activation energies are in a good agreement with experimental data. The approximations underlying this procedure are discussed.},

These calculations require hours to a day on a commodity computer. The calculations also indicate that the changes in configurational entropy upon binding oppose association by as much as 24 kcal/mol and result primarily from a narrowing of energy wells in the bound versus the free state, rather than from a drop in the number of distinct low-energy conformations on binding. Also, the configurational entropy is found to vary substantially among the bound conformations of a given cyclodextrin-guest complex. This result suggests that the configurational entropy must be accounted for to reliably rank docked conformations in both host-guest and ligand-protein complexes. In close analogy with the common experimental observation of entropy-enthalpy compensation, the computed entropy changes show a near-linear relationship with the changes in mean potential plus solvation energy.},

The free-energy profiles that delineate the inclusion process were determined using an adaptive biasing force. The present results reveal that although the free-energy surfaces feature two local minima corresponding to a partial and a complete inclusion, the former mode is markedly preferred, irrespective of the orientation. Ranking the propensity of the three steroidal molecules to associate with $\beta$-CD, viz. progesterone $>$ testosterone $>$ hydrocortisone, is shown to be in excellent agreement with experiment. This conclusion is further supported by independent calculations relying on alchemical transformations in conjunction with free energy perturbation, wherein the relative binding free energy for the three steroids was estimated. In addition, decomposition of the potentials of mean force into free-energy contributions and significant decrease in the total hydrophobic surface area suggest that by and large, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions constitute the main driving forces responsible for the formation of the inclusion complexes. Analysis of their structural features from the molecular dynamics trajectories brings to light different hydrogen-bonding patterns that are characterized by distinct dynamics and stabilities.},

Due to their small size relative to much larger protein\textendash{}ligand complexes, converged results can be obtained rapidly for these systems thus offering the opportunity to more reliably study fundamental aspects of the thermodynamics of binding. In this work, we have performed a large scale binding affinity survey of 57 $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) host\textendash{}guest systems using the binding energy distribution analysis method (BEDAM) with implicit solvation (OPLS-AA/AGBNP2). Converged estimates of the standard binding free energies are obtained for these systems by employing techniques such as parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics, conformational reservoirs, and multistate free energy estimators. Good agreement with experimental measurements is obtained in terms of both numerical accuracy and affinity rankings. Overall, average effective binding energies reproduce affinity rank ordering better than the calculated binding affinities, even though calculated binding free energies, which account for effects such as conformational strain and entropy loss upon binding, provide lower root-mean-square errors when compared to measurements. Interestingly, we find that binding free energies are superior rank order predictors for a large subset containing the most flexible guests. The results indicate that, while challenging, accurate modeling of reorganization effects can lead to ligand design models of superior predictive power for rank ordering relative to models based only on ligand\textendash{}receptor interaction energies.},

In this work, the chiral recognition ability of $\beta$-cyclodextrin to one of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ketoprofen, has been systematically investigated using molecular dynamics and free energy simulation methods. The R- and S-enantiomers of ketoprofen were explicitly bound within the cyclodextrin cavity in our simulations, respectively. In consistent with experimental observations, tiny structural difference between two isomers could be observed. Calculated absolute binding free energies using adapted biasing force (ABF) method and MM/GBSA approach for both isomers are comparable to experimental values. Significant binding fluctuations along the MD trajectory have been observed. The free energy profiles calculated using two different approaches reveal that the ketoprofen prefers binding in the cavity with the carboxylate group facing the wider edge of $\beta$-cyclodextrin.

  abstract = {Evaluation of solvation (binding) free energies with implicit solvent models in different dielectric environments for biological simulations as well as high throughput ligand screening remain challenging endeavors. In order to address how well implicit solvent models approximate explicit ones we examined four generalized Born models (GBStill, GBHCT, GBOBCI, and GBOBCII) for determining the dimerization free energy ($\Delta$G0) of $\beta$-cyclodextrin monomers in 17 implicit solvents with dielectric constants (D) ranging from 5 to 80 and compared the results to previous free energy calculations with explicit solvents (Zhang et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2012, 116, 12684-12693). The comparison indicates that neglecting the environmental dependence of Born radii appears acceptable for such calculations involving cyclodextrin and that the GBStill and GBOBCI models yield a reasonable estimation of $\Delta$G0, although the details of binding are quite different from explicit solvents. Large discrepancies between implicit and explicit solvent models occur in high-dielectric media with strong hydrogen bond (HB) interruption properties. $\Delta$G0 with the GB models is shown to correlate strongly to 2(D\textendash{}1)/(2D+1) (R2 $\sim$ 0.90) in line with the Onsager reaction field (Onsager J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1936, 58, 1486-1493) but to be very sensitive to D (D $<$ 10) as well. Both high-dielectric environments where hydrogen bonds are of interest and low-dielectric media such as protein binding pockets and membrane interiors therefore need to be considered with caution in GB-based calculations. Finally, a literature analysis of Gibbs energy of solvation of small molecules in organic liquids shows that the Onsager relation does not hold for real molecules since the correlation between $\Delta$G0 and 2(D\textendash{}1)/(2D+1) is low for most solutes. Interestingly, explicit solvent calculations of the solvation free energy (Zhang et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1192-1201) reproduce the weak experimental correlations with 2(D\textendash{}1)/(2D+1) very well.},

The isolation of a defined size LR-CD is an essential prerequisite for studying their structural properties. Unfortunately the purification procedure of these substances turned out to be very laborious. Finally the problem could be circumvented by a theoretical consideration: the highly advantageous replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation (particularly suitable for studies of conformational changes) offers an ideal approach for studying the conformational change of $\varepsilon$-cyclodextrin (CD10), a smaller representative of LR-CDs. Three carbohydrate force fields and three solvent models were tested. The conformational behavior of CD10 was analyzed in terms of the flip (turn) of the glucose subunits within the macrocyclic ring. In addition a ranking of conformations with various numbers of turns was preformed. Our findings might be also helpful in the temperature controlled synthesis of LR-CDs as well as other experimental conditions, in particular for the host\textendash{}guest reaction.},

The double decoupling approach was employed to calculate the standard binding free enthalpy of 1-hexanol, while for all other compounds relative binding free enthalpies for pairs of alcohols differing by two carbon atoms were calculated from twin-system enveloping distribution sampling simulations. While all three force fields slightly overestimate the magnitude of the standard binding free enthalpy of 1-hexanol the 53A6GLYC and 56A6CARBO\_R+ parameter sets are a little closer to the experimental data than 56A6CARBO\_R. For relative binding free enthalpies no significant difference between the force fields was observed. All three force fields support those experimental measurements that found a distinct increase in the binding affinity with increasing number of carbon atoms even for longer chain lengths up to 1-dodecanol.},

  abstract = {A new derivation of the GLYCAM06 force field, which removes its previous specificity for carbohydrates, and its dependency on the AMBER force field and parameters, is presented. All pertinent force field terms have been explicitly specified and so no default or generic parameters are employed. The new GLYCAM is no longer limited to any particular class of biomolecules, but is extendible to all molecular classes in the spirit of a small-molecule force field. The torsion terms in the present work were all derived from quantum mechanical data from a collection of minimal molecular fragments and related small molecules. For carbohydrates, there is now a single parameter set applicable to both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-anomers and to all monosaccharide ring sizes and conformations. We demonstrate that deriving dihedral parameters by fitting to QM data for internal rotational energy curves for representative small molecules generally leads to correct rotamer populations in molecular dynamics simulations, and that this approach removes the need for phase corrections in the dihedral terms. However, we note that there are cases where this approach is inadequate. Reported here are the basic components of the new force field as well as an illustration of its extension to carbohydrates. In addition to reproducing the gas-phase properties of an array of small test molecules, condensed-phase simulations employing GLYCAM06 are shown to reproduce rotamer populations for key small molecules and representative biopolymer building blocks in explicit water, as well as crystalline lattice properties, such as unit cell dimensions, and vibrational frequencies. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The present work details the development of force-field parameters for these monosaccharides and their covalent connections to proteins via O linkages to serine or threonine side chains and via N linkages to asparagine side chains. The force field development protocol was designed to explicitly yield parameters that are compatible with the existing CHARMM additive force field for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and small molecules. Therefore, when combined with previously developed parameters for pyranose and furanose monosaccharides, for glycosidic linkages between monosaccharides, and for proteins, the present set of parameters enables the molecular simulation of a wide variety of biologically important molecules such as complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins. Parametrization included fitting to quantum mechanical (QM) geometries and conformational energies of model compounds, as well as to QM pair interaction energies and distances of model compounds with water. Parameters were validated in the context of crystals of relevant monosaccharides, as well NMR and/or X-ray crystallographic data on larger systems including oligomeric hyaluronan, sialyl Lewis X, O- and N-linked glycopeptides, and a lectin:sucrose complex. As the validated parameters are an extension of the CHARMM all-atom additive biomolecular force field, they further broaden the types of heterogeneous systems accessible with a consistently developed force-field model.},

Over past decades, computational study of carbohydrates has been focused on the development of structure prediction methods, force field optimization, molecular dynamics simulation, and scoring functions for carbohydrate\textendash{}protein interactions. Advances in carbohydrate force fields and scoring functions can be largely attributed to enhanced computational algorithms, application of quantum mechanics, and the increasing number of experimental structures determined by X-ray and NMR techniques. The conformational analysis of carbohydrates is challengeable and has gone into intensive study in elucidating the anomeric, the exo-anomeric, and the gauche effects.

  abstract = {It is well known that high hydrostatic pressures can induce the unfolding of proteins. The physical underpinnings of this phenomenon have been investigated extensively but remain controversial. Changes in solvation energetics have been commonly proposed as a driving force for pressure-induced unfolding. Recently, the elimination of void volumes in the native folded state has been argued to be the principal determinant. Here we use the cavity-containing L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme to examine the pressure-induced destabilization of this multidomain protein by using solution NMR spectroscopy. The cavity-containing C-terminal domain completely unfolds at moderate pressures, whereas the N-terminal domain remains largely structured to pressures as high as 2.5 kbar. The sensitivity to pressure is suppressed by the binding of benzene to the hydrophobic cavity. These results contrast to the pseudo-WT protein, which has a residual cavity volume very similar to that of the L99A\textendash{}benzene complex but shows extensive subglobal reorganizations with pressure. Encapsulation of the L99A mutant in the aqueous nanoscale core of a reverse micelle is used to examine the hydration of the hydrophobic cavity. The confined space effect of encapsulation suppresses the pressure-induced unfolding transition and allows observation of the filling of the cavity with water at elevated pressures. This indicates that hydration of the hydrophobic cavity is more energetically unfavorable than global unfolding. Overall, these observations point to a range of cooperativity and energetics within the T4 lysozyme molecule and illuminate the fact that small changes in physical parameters can significantly alter the pressure sensitivity of proteins.},

  abstract = {Application of hydrostatic pressure shifts protein conformational equilibria in a direction to reduce the volume of the system. A current view is that the volume reduction is dominated by elimination of voids or cavities in the protein interior via cavity hydration, although an alternative mechanism wherein cavities are filled with protein side chains resulting from a structure relaxation has been suggested [L{\'o}pez CJ, Yang Z, Altenbach C, Hubbell WL (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(46):E4306\textendash{}E4315]. In the present study, mechanisms for elimination of cavities under high pressure are investigated in the L99A cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme and derivatives thereof using site-directed spin labeling, pressure-resolved double electron\textendash{}electron resonance, and high-pressure circular dichroism spectroscopy. In the L99A mutant, the ground state is in equilibrium with an excited state of only $\sim$3\% of the population in which the cavity is filled by a protein side chain [Bouvignies et al. (2011) Nature 477(7362):111\textendash{}114]. The results of the present study show that in L99A the native ground state is the dominant conformation to pressures of 3 kbar, with cavity hydration apparently taking place in the range of 2\textendash{}3 kbar. However, in the presence of additional mutations that lower the free energy of the excited state, pressure strongly populates the excited state, thereby eliminating the cavity with a native side chain rather than solvent. Thus, both cavity hydration and structure relaxation are mechanisms for cavity elimination under pressure, and which is dominant is determined by details of the energy landscape.},

  abstract = {For a number of proteins, folding occurs via the rapid accumulation of secondary and tertiary structural features in a so-called burst phase, preceding the relatively slow, highly activated transition leading to the native state. A fundamental question is: do these burst phase reactions comprise two phase-separated thermodynamic states or a continuum of states? Ribonuclease HI (RNase H) from Escherichia coli and phage T4 lysozyme (T4L) both exhibit such a phenomenon. Native-state hydrogen exchange (NHX) data have been collected for these proteins, providing residue-specific free energies and m-values (a measure of hydrocarbon solvation) for the manifold of partially unfolded, exchange-competent forms that are accessible from the native state ($\Delta$Gsg and msg, where the sg subscript denotes sub-global). There is good evidence that these parameters pertain to exchange-competent species comprising the burst phase observed in the global folding kinetics. We combine the results from the global folding kinetics of these proteins with a statistical analysis of their NHX parameters to determine if the distribution of experimental (msg, $\Delta$Gsg) values derive from a mechanism where the burst phase is two-state. For RNase H, this analysis demonstrates that the burst phase of this protein is not two-state; the results imply a distribution of states, m and $\Delta$G exhibiting a linear functional relationship consistent with the global folding parameters. For T4L, it is difficult to distinguish the observed distribution of msg, $\Delta$Gsg values from that expected for a mechanism where the burst phase is two-state. The results for RNase H${_\ast}$ lend support for the idea that the burst phase reaction of this protein comprises a continuum of states. This has important implications for how we model the process of structural acquisition in protein folding reactions.},

  abstract = {Proteins are inherently plastic molecules, whose function often critically depends on excursions between different molecular conformations (conformers). However, a rigorous understanding of the relation between a protein/'s structure, dynamics and function remains elusive. This is because many of the conformers on its energy landscape are only transiently formed and marginally populated (less than a few per cent of the total number of molecules), so that they cannot be individually characterized by most biophysical tools. Here we study a lysozyme mutant from phage T4 that binds hydrophobic molecules and populates an excited state transiently (about 1\,ms) to about 3\% at 25\,$^\circ$C (ref. 5). We show that such binding occurs only via the ground state, and present the atomic-level model of the /`invisible/', excited state obtained using a combined strategy of relaxation-dispersion NMR (ref. 6) and CS-Rosetta model building that rationalizes this observation. The model was tested using structure-based design calculations identifying point mutants predicted to stabilize the excited state relative to the ground state. In this way a pair of mutations were introduced, inverting the relative populations of the ground and excited states and altering function. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution of a protein/'s function by changing the delicate balance between the states on its energy landscape. More generally, they show that our approach can generate and validate models of excited protein states.},

Research of this kind has led to a wealth of knowledge about what stabilizes proteins in their folded states. To gain a more complete picture requires that we perturb these structures in a continuous manner, something mutagenesis cannot achieve. With high pressure crystallographic methods it is now possible to explore the detailed properties of proteins while continuously varying thermodynamic parameters. Here, we detail the structural response of the cavity-containing mutant L99A of T4 lysozyme, as well as its pseudo wild-type (WT*) counterpart, to hydrostatic pressure. Surprisingly, the cavity has almost no effect on the pressure response: virtually the same changes are observed in WT* as in L99A under pressure. The cavity is most rigid, while other regions deform substantially. This implies that while some residues may increase the thermodynamic stability of a protein, they may also be structurally irrelevant. As recently shown, the cavity fills with water at pressures above 100~MPa while retaining its overall size. The resultant picture of the protein is one in which conformationally fluctuating side groups provide a liquid-like environment, but which also contribute to the rigidity of the peptide backbone.},

APLoD greatly improves the popular density peaks algorithm by reducing the running time and the memory usage by 2\textendash{}3 orders of magnitude for systems ranging from alanine dipeptide to a 370-residue Maltose-binding protein. In addition, we demonstrate that APLoD can produce clusters with various sizes that are adaptive to the underlying density (i.e., larger clusters at low-density regions, while smaller clusters at high-density regions), which is a clear advantage over other popular clustering algorithms including k-centers and k-medoids. We anticipate that APLoD can be widely applied to split ultra-large MD datasets containing millions of conformations for subsequent construction of Markov State Models. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We here propose a scheme based on the maximum entropy principle to combine simulations with bulk experiments. In the proposed scheme the noise arising from both the measurements and the forward models used to back calculate the experimental observables is explicitly taken into account. The method is tested on RNA nucleosides and is then used to construct chemically consistent corrections to the Amber RNA force field that allow a large set of experimental data on nucleosides and dinucleosides to be correctly reproduced. The transferability of these corrections is assessed against independent data on tetranucleotides and displays a previously unreported agreement with experiments. This procedure can be applied to enforce multiple experimental data on multiple systems in a self- consistent framework thus suggesting a new paradigm for force field refinement.},

  abstract = {Continuing the development of the FFLUX, a multipolar polarizable force field driven by machine learning, we present a modern approach to atom-typing and building transferable models for predicting atomic properties in proteins. Amino acid atomic charges in a peptide chain respond to the substitution of a neighboring residue and this response can be categorized in a manner similar to atom-typing. Using a machine learning method called kriging, we are able to build predictive models for an atom that is defined, not only by its local environment, but also by its neighboring residues, for a minimal additional computational cost. We found that prediction errors were up to 11 times lower when using a model specific to the correct group of neighboring residues, with a mean prediction of $\sim$0.0015 au. This finding suggests that atoms in a force field should be defined by more than just their immediate atomic neighbors. When comparing an atom in a single alanine to an analogous atom in a deca-alanine helix, the mean difference in charge is 0.026 au. Meanwhile, the same difference between a trialanine and a deca-alanine helix is only 0.012 au. When compared to deca-alanine models, the transferable models are up to 20 times faster to train, and require significantly less ab initio calculation, providing a practical route to modeling large biological systems. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Stochastic dynamics is a widely employed strategy to achieve local thermostatization in molecular dynamics simulation studies; however, it suffers from an inherent violation of momentum conservation. Although this short-coming has little impact on structural and short-time dynamic properties, it can be shown that dynamics in the long-time limit such as diffusion is strongly dependent on the respective thermostat setting. Application of the methodically similar dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) provides a simple, effective strategy to ensure the advantages of local, stochastic thermostatization while at the same time the linear momentum of the system remains conserved. In this work, the key parameters to employ the DPD thermostats in the framework of periodic boundary conditions are investigated, in particular the dependence of the system properties on the size of the DPD-region as well as the treatment of forces near the cutoff. Structural and dynamical data for light and heavy water as well as a Lennard\textendash{}Jones fluid have been compared to simulations executed via stochastic dynamics as well as via use of the widely employed Nose\textendash{}Hoover chain and Berendsen thermostats. It is demonstrated that a small size of the DPD region is sufficient to achieve local thermalization, while at the same time artifacts in the self-diffusion characteristic for stochastic dynamics are eliminated. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Poor aqueous solubility leads to low bio-availability, reducing pharmaceutical effectiveness. The human cost of inefficient drug candidate testing is of great medical concern, with fewer drugs making it to the production line, slowing the development of new treatments. In biochemistry and biophysics, water mediated reactions and interactions within active sites and protein pockets are an active area of research, in which methods for modelling solvated systems are continually pushed to their limits. Here, we discuss a multitude of methods aimed towards solvent modelling and solubility prediction, aiming to inform the reader of the options available, and outlining the various advantages and disadvantages of each approach.},

To further facilitate the usability of alchemical methods for amino acid mutations, we have developed a web based infrastructure for obtaining hybrid protein structures and topologies. The presented webserver allows amino acid mutation selection in five contemporary molecular mechanics force fields. In addition, a complete mutation scan with a user defined amino acid is supported. The output generated by the webserver is directly compatible with the Gromacs molecular dynamics engine and can be used with any of the alchemical free energy calculation setup. Furthermore, we present a database of input files and precalculated free energy differences for tripeptides approximating a disordered state of a protein, of particular use for protein stability studies. Finally, the usage of the webserver and its output is exemplified by performing an alanine scan and investigating thermodynamic stability of the Trp cage mini protein.

This approach does not account for polarization in larger molecules or proteins, and the parametrization process is labor-intensive. Using linear-scaling density functional theory and atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning, environment-specific charges and Lennard-Jones parameters are derived directly from quantum mechanical calculations for use in biomolecular modeling of organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed methods significantly reduce the number of empirical parameters needed to construct molecular mechanics force fields, naturally include polarization effects in charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and scale well to systems comprised of thousands of atoms, including proteins. The feasibility and benefits of this approach are demonstrated by computing free energies of hydration, properties of pure liquids, and the relative binding free energies of indole and benzofuran to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme.},

The framework associates the variability of the optimal parameters of the MD potentials under different environmental conditions with the corresponding variability in experimental data. The high computational cost associated with the hierarchical Bayesian framework is reduced by orders of magnitude through a parallelized Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method combined with the Laplace Asymptotic Approximation. The suitability of the hierarchical approach is demonstrated by performing MD simulations with prescribed parameters to obtain data for transport coefficients under different conditions, which are then used to infer and evaluate the parameters of the MD model. We demonstrate the selection of MD models based on experimental data and verify that the hierarchical model can accurately quantify the uncertainty across experiments; improve the posterior probability density function estimation of the parameters, thus, improve predictions on future experiments; identify the most plausible force field to describe the underlying structure of a given dataset. The framework and associated software are applicable to a wide range of nanoscale simulations associated with experimental data with a hierarchical structure.},

  abstract = {During recent decades it has become feasible to simulate the dynamics of molecular systems on a computer. The method of molecular dynamics (MD) solves Newton's equations of motion for a molecular system, which results in trajectories for all atoms in the system. From these atomic trajectories a variety of properties can be calculated. The aim of computer simulations of molecular systems is to compute macroscopic behavior from microscopic interactions. The main contributions a microscopic consideration can offer are (1) the understanding and (2) interpretation of experimental results, (3) semiquantitative estimates of experimental results, and (4) the capability to interpolate or extrapolate experimental data into regions that are only difficultly accessible in the laboratory. One of the two basic problems in the field of molecular modeling and simulation is how to efficiently search the vast configuration space which is spanned by all possible molecular conformations for the global low (free) energy regions which will be populated by a molecular system in thermal equilibrium. The other basic problem is the derivation of a sufficiently accurate interaction energy function or force field for the molecular system of interest. An important part of the art of computer simulation is to choose the unavoidable assumptions, approximations and simplifications of the molecular model and computational procedure such that their contributions to the overall inaccuracy are of comparable size, without affecting significantly the property of interest. Methodology and some practical applications of computer simulation in the field of (bio)chemistry will be reviewed.},

  abstract = {The derivation and optimization of most energy terms in modern force fields are aided by automated computational tools. It is therefore important to have algorithms to rapidly and precisely train large numbers of interconnected parameters to allow investigators to make better decisions about the content of molecular models. In particular, the traditional approach to deriving dihedral parameters has been a least-squares fit to target conformational energies through variational optimization strategies. We present a computational approach for simultaneously fitting force field dihedral amplitudes and phase constants which is analytic within the scope of the data set. This approach completes the optimal molecular mechanics representation of a quantum mechanical potential energy surface in a single linear least-squares fit by recasting the dihedral potential into a linear function in the parameters. We compare the resulting method to a genetic algorithm in terms of computational time and quality of fit for two simple molecules. As suggested in previous studies, arbitrary dihedral phases are only necessary when modeling chiral molecules, which include more than half of drugs currently in use, so we also examined a dihedral parametrization case for the drug amoxicillin and one of its stereoisomers where the target dihedral includes a chiral center. Asymmetric dihedral phases are needed in these types of cases to properly represent the quantum mechanical energy surface and to differentiate between stereoisomers about the chiral center.},

  abstract = {The quality of atomistic simulations depends decisively on the accuracy of the underlying energy function (force field). Of particular importance for condensed-phase properties are nonbonded interactions, including the electrostatic and Lennard-Jones terms. Permanent atomic multipoles (MTPs) are an extension to common point-charge (PC) representations in atomistic simulations. MTPs are commonly determined from and fitted to an ab initio Electrostatic Potential (ESP), and Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters are obtained from comparison of experimental and computed observables using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For this a set of thermodynamic observables such as density, heat of vaporization, and hydration free energy is chosen, to which the parametrization is fitted. The current work introduces a comprehensive computing environment (Fitting Wizard (FW)) for optimizing nonbonded interactions for atomistic force fields of different qualities. The FW supports fitting of standard PC-based force fields and more physically motivated multipolar (MTP) force fields. A broader study including 20 molecules ranging from N-methyl-acetamide and benzene to halogenated benzenes, phenols, anilines, and pyridines yields a root mean squared deviation for hydration free energies of 0.36 kcal/mol over a range of 8 kcal/mol. It is furthermore shown that PC-based force fields are not necessarily inferior compared to MTP parametrizations depending on the molecule considered.},

The reliable generation of molecular models is a critical issue to do so. Hence, striving for semiautomated and fully automated parameterization of entire force fields for molecular simulations, the authors developed several modular program packages in recent years. The programs run with limited user interactions and can be executed in parallel on modern computer clusters. Various interlinked resolutions of molecular modeling are addressed: For intramolecular interactions, a force-field optimization package named Wolf2Pack has been developed that transfers knowledge gained from quantum mechanics to Newtonian-based molecular models. For intermolecular interactions, especially Lennard\textendash{}Jones parameters, a modular optimization toolkit of programs and scripts has been created combining global and local optimization algorithms. Global optimization is performed by a tool named CoSMoS, while local optimization is done by the gradient-based optimization workflow named GROW or by a derivative-free method called SpaGrOW. The overall goal of all program packages is to realize an easy, efficient, and user-friendly development of reliable force-field parameters in a reasonable time. The various tools are needed and interlinked since different stages of the optimization process demand different courses of action. In this paper, the conception of all programs involved is presented and how they communicate with each other.},

  abstract = {In this study, the recently developed gradient-based optimisation workflow for the automated development of molecular models is for the first time applied to the parameterisation of force fields for molecular dynamics simulations. As a proof-of-concept, two small molecules (benzene and phosgene) are considered. In order to optimise the underlying intermolecular force field (described by the (12,6)-Lennard-Jones and the Coulomb potential), the energetic and diameter parameters $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ are fitted to experimental physical properties by gradient-based numerical optimisation techniques. Thereby, a quadratic loss function between experimental and simulated target properties is minimised with respect to the force field parameters. In this proof-of-concept, the considered physical target properties are chosen to be diverse: density, enthalpy of vapourisation and self-diffusion coefficient are optimised simultaneously at different temperatures. We found that in both cases, the optimisation could be successfully concluded by fulfillment of a pre-defined stopping criterion. Since a fairly small number of iterations were needed to do so, this study will serve as a good starting point for more complex systems and further improvements of the parametrisation task.},

In this study, we develop new amino acid backbone dihedral angle potential energy parameters based on the widely used 54A7 parameter set by matching to experimental J values and secondary structure propensity scales. In order to find the most appropriate backbone parameters, close to 100 000 different combinations of parameters have been screened. However, since the sheer number of combinations considered prohibits actual molecular dynamics simulations for each of them, we instead predicted the values for every combination using Hamiltonian reweighting. While the original 54A7 parameter set fails to reproduce the experimental data, we are able to provide parameters that match significantly better. However, to ensure applicability in the context of larger peptides and full proteins, further studies have to be undertaken.},

CBs are of high interest in chemistry and biology due to their versatile applications, ranging from sensors to advanced drug-delivery systems. Here, we report a systematic hydration study of all currently known CBs by classical molecular dynamics simulations to understand their different aqueous solubilities, as revealed in the experiments. Water readily penetrates CBs, including the smallest CB, that is, CB[5]. The number of CB[n]\textendash{}water hydrogen bonds can be assessed as 2 \texttimes{} n. The hydration enthalpies of the CBs were found to be significantly favorable, due to a number of strong hydrogen bonds with water. However, these enthalpy gains are not enough to compensate for an even larger entropic penalty due to modifying a genuine bulk arrangement of water molecules. We found that the free energy of hydration moderately but uniformly increases with the number of GLYCs. Therefore, the better solubility of odd-numbered CBs is independent of the CB\textendash{}water interactions, either an enthalpic or entropic contribution. The higher solubilities of CB[n]s with n = 5, 7, or 9 occur exclusively because of their amorphous solid states. Our results allow the prognosis of the aqueous solubilities of not-yet-synthesized CBs.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present conformational energies for a molecular mechanical model (Parm99) developed for organic and biological molecules using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach to derive the partial charges. This approach uses the simple ``generic'' force field model (Parm94), and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a physical justification. The results are quite encouraging, not only for the 34-molecule set that has been studied by both the highest level ab initiomodel (GVB/LMP2) and experiment, but also for the 55-molecule set for which high-quality experimental data are available. Considering the 55 molecules studied by all the force field models for which there are experimental data, the average absolute errors (AAEs) are 0.28 (this model), 0.52 (MM3), 0.57 (CHARMm [MSI]), and 0.43 kcal/mol (MMFF). For the 34-molecule set, the AAEs of this model versus experiment and ab initio are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, respectively. This is a lower error than found with MM3 and CHARMm, and is comparable to that found with MMFF (0.31 and 0.22 kcal/mol). We also present two examples of how well the torsional parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set. The absolute errors of molecules in the test set are only slightly larger than in the training set (differences of $<$0.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be concluded that a simple ``generic'' force field with a limited number of specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermolecular interactions, although all comparison molecules were selected from our 82-compound training set. We also show how this effective two-body model can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field (NAFF), both with and without lone pairs. Without changing the torsional parameters, the use of more accurate charges and polarization leads to an increase in average absolute error compared with experiment, but adjustment of the parameters restores the level of agreement found with the additive model. After reoptimizing the $\Psi$, $\Phi$ torsional parameters in peptides using alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11 conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the Cornell et al. ( J Am Chem Soc 1995, 117, 5179\textendash{}5197) force field. The average absolute error of this model for high-level ab initio calculation is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model. For nucleosides, the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et al. model. To optimize force field parameters, we developed a program called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a systematic manner and finally obtain the best torsional potentials. Besides the organic molecules in our test set, parmscan was also successful in optimizing the $\Psi$, $\Phi$ torsional parameters in peptides to significantly improve agreement between molecular mechanical and high-level ab initio energies. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

For the unbound host, we find that the host cavity favors the hydrated state over the dry state due to electrostatic effects. For the guest binding, we find reasonable agreement to experimental binding affinities. Dissection of the individual VISM free-energy contributions shows that the major driving forces are water-mediated hydrophobic interactions and the intrinsic (vacuum) host\textendash{}guest van der Waals interactions. These findings are in line with recent experiments and molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent. It is expected that the level-set VISM, with further refinement on the electrostatic descriptions, can efficiently predict molecular binding and recognition in a wide range of future applications.},

  abstract = {The present work deals with a formal discussion on complications associated with using combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potentials in free energy perturbation simulations. Because quantum mechanical potentials are not trivially separable and because of the difficulty associated with QM calculations for ``fractional'' electronic Hamiltonians, conventional computational strategies cannot be straightforwardly applied to free energy simulations with QM/MM potentials. Here, we propose a unique coupling scheme, termed the ``dual-topology-single-coordinate'' scheme, in which the two chemical states are forced to adopt the same set of Cartesian coordinates during the perturbation simulation; the method is exact because the free energy difference is independent of the coupling path, although a formal proof is also given. The scheme combines the merits of the conventional dual- and single-topology approaches:\, both coupling potential and free energy derivative are straightforward to compute for any form of QM method (even if nonvariational) and QM/MM coupling scheme, calculations can be performed at end points without numerical/sampling instabilities, no corrections related to artifactual reference states or Jacobian factors have to be considered, and numerical convergence is rapid. The method is illustrated with an application to the redox potential of FAD in cholesterol oxidase. It was found that the protein and solvent respond in approximately a linear fashion to the reduction of FAD with a small reorganization energy; the bulk solvent makes an essential contribution to compensate for the reorganization of the protein. The contribution of Asn 485 was found to be around 1.3 kcal/mol with several different simulations, which is close to the experimental estimate based on mutation studies.},

  abstract = {The reliability of free energy simulations (FES) is limited by two factors: (a) the need for correct sampling and (b) the accuracy of the computational method employed. Classical methods (e.g., force fields) are typically used for FES and present a myriad of challenges, with parametrization being a principle one. On the other hand, parameter-free quantum mechanical (QM) methods tend to be too computationally expensive for adequate sampling. One widely used approach is a combination of methods, where the free energy difference between the two end states is computed by, e.g., molecular mechanics (MM), and the end states are corrected by more accurate methods, such as QM or hybrid QM/MM techniques. Here we report two new approaches that significantly improve the aforementioned scheme; with a focus on how to compute corrections between, e.g., the MM and the more accurate QM calculations. First, a molecular dynamics trajectory that properly samples relevant conformational degrees of freedom is generated. Next, potential energies of each trajectory frame are generated with a QM or QM/MM Hamiltonian. Free energy differences are then calculated based on the QM or QM/MM energies using either a non-Boltzmann Bennett approach (QM-NBB) or non-Boltzmann free energy perturbation (NB-FEP). Both approaches are applied to calculate relative and absolute solvation free energies in explicit and implicit solvent environments. Solvation free energy differences (relative and absolute) between ethane and methanol in explicit solvent are used as the initial test case for QM-NBB. Next, implicit solvent methods are employed in conjunction with both QM-NBB and NB-FEP to compute absolute solvation free energies for 21 compounds. These compounds range from small molecules such as ethane and methanol to fairly large, flexible solutes, such as triacetyl glycerol. Several technical aspects were investigated. Ultimately some best practices are suggested for improving methods that seek to connect MM to QM (or QM/MM) levels of theory in FES.},

When NBB is applied with the SMD implicit solvent model, and the OLYP/DZP level of quantum chemistry, highly accurate hydration free energy calculations are obtained with respect to experiment (RMSD = 0.89 kcal$\cdot$mol-1). Other quantum chemical methods are also tested, and the effects of solvent model, density functional, basis set are explored in this benchmarking study, providing a framework for improvements in calculating hydration free energies. We provide a practical guide for using the best QM-NBB protocols that are consistently more accurate than either pure QM or pure MM alone. In situations where high accuracy hydration free energy predictions are needed, the QM-NBB method with SMD implicit solvent should be the first choice of quantum chemists.},

Relative free energies of binding are first computed using classical force fields, Monte Carlo sampling, and replica exchange thermodynamic integration. Snapshots of the configurations at the end points of the perturbation are then subjected to DFT-QM/MM single-point calculations using the B3LYP functional and a range of basis sets. The resulting quantum mechanical energies are then processed using the Zwanzig equation to give free energies incorporating electronic polarization. Our approach is conceptually simple and does not require tightly coupled QM and MM software. The method has been validated by calculating the relative free energies of hydration of methane and water and the relative free energy of binding of two inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2. Closed thermodynamic cycles are obtained across different pathways, demonstrating the correctness of the technique, although significantly more sampling is required for the protein-ligand system. Our method offers a simple and effective way to incorporate quantum mechanical effects into computed free energies of binding.},

We use single-step exponential averaging (ssEA) and the non-Boltzmann Bennett acceptance ratio (NBB) methods to estimate QM/MM free energy with the semi-empirical PM6-DH2X method, both based on interaction energies. We show that ssEA with cumulant expansion gives a better convergence and uses half as many QM calculations as NBB, although the two methods give consistent results. With 720,000 QM calculations per transformation, QM/MM free-energy estimates with a precision of 1 kJ/mol can be obtained for all eight relative energies with ssEA, showing that this approach can be used to calculate converged QM/MM binding free energies for realistic systems and large QM partitions. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

Undoubtedly, each of these plays an important role in the lack of predictivity seen in most QSAR models. Likely to be just as important is the role of the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc in the poor prediction seen with many QSAR models. By embracing fallacy along with an over reliance on statistical inference, it may well be that the manner in which QSAR is practiced is more responsible for its lack of success than any other innate cause.},

The energy function includes stereochemistry, dynamic fragment assembly, distance-scaled finite ideal gas reference (DFIRE), and generalized orientation- and distance-dependent terms. For the conformational search of loop structures, we used the CSA algorithm, which has been quite successful in dealing with various hard global optimization problems. We assessed the performance of EPLM with two widely used loop-decoy sets, Jacobson and RAPPER, and compared the results against the DFIRE potential. The accuracy of model selection from a pool of loop decoys as well as de novo loop modeling starting from randomly generated structures was examined separately. For the selection of a nativelike structure from a decoy set, EPLM was more accurate than DFIRE in the case of the Jacobson set and had similar accuracy in the case of the RAPPER set. In terms of sampling more nativelike loop structures, EPLM outperformed EDFIRE for both decoy sets. This new approach equipped with EPLM and CSA can serve as the state-of-the-art de novo loop modeling method.},

Usually, structural information from fragment\textendash{}protein complexes is used to develop ideas about the binding mode of similar but drug-like molecules. In this regard, crystallization additives such as cryoprotectants or buffer components, which are highly abundant in crystal structures, are frequently ignored. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the information present in protein complexes with fragments as well as those with additives and how they relate to the binding modes of their drug-like counterparts. We present a thorough analysis of the binding modes of crystallographic additives, fragments, and drug-like ligands bound to four diverse targets of wide interest in drug discovery and highly represented in the Protein Data Bank: cyclin-dependent kinase 2, $\beta$-secretase 1, carbonic anhydrase 2, and trypsin. We identified a total of 630 unique molecules bound to the catalytic binding sites, among them 31 additives, 222 fragments, and 377 drug-like ligands. In general, we observed that, independent of the target, protein\textendash{}fragment interaction patterns are highly similar to those of drug-like ligands and mostly cover the residues crucial for binding. Crystallographic additives are also able to show conserved binding modes and recover the residues important for binding in some of the cases. Moreover, we show evidence that the information from fragments and drug-like ligands can be applied to rescore docking poses in order to improve the prediction of binding modes.},

Starting with reported nonbonded parameters of alcohols, ethers, and diols, torsional parameters were fit to reproduce results from ab initio calculations on the hexopyranoses, $\alpha$,$\beta$-d-glucopyranose, $\alpha$,$\beta$-d-mannopyranose, $\alpha$,$\beta$-d-galactopyranose, methyl $\alpha$,$\beta$-d-glucopyranoside, and methyl $\alpha$,$\beta$-d-mannopyranoside. In all, geometry optimizations were carried out for 144 conformers at the restricted Hartree\textendash{}Fock (RHF)/6\textendash{}31G* level. For the conformers with a relative energy within 3 kcal/mol of the global minima, the effects of electron correlation and basis-set extension were considered by performing single-point calculations with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6\textendash{}311+G** level. The torsional parameters for the OPLS-AA force field were parameterized to reproduce the energies and structures of these 44 conformers. The resultant force field reproduces the ab initio calculated energies with an average unsigned error of 0.41 kcal/mol. The $\alpha$/$\beta$ ratios as well as the relative energies between the isomeric hexopyranoses are in good accord with the ab initio results. The predictive abilities of the force field were also tested against RHF/6\textendash{}31G* results for d-allopyranose with excellent success; a surprising discovery is that the lowest energy conformer of d-allopyranose is a $\beta$ anomer.~\textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.~J Comput Chem18: 1955\textendash{}1970, 1997},

Such a flexibility makes this force field a potential good candidate for simulations involving a large spectrum of systems and, indeed, UFF has been applied to various families of molecules. Unfortunately, initializing UFF, that is, performing molecular structure perception to determine which parameters should be used to compute the UFF energy and forces, appears to be a difficult problem. Although many perception methods exist, they mostly focus on organic molecules, and are thus not well-adapted to the diversity of systems potentially considered with UFF. In this article, we propose an automatic perception method for initializing UFF that includes the identification of the system's connectivity, the assignment of bond orders as well as UFF atom types. This perception scheme is proposed as a self-contained UFF implementation integrated in a new module for the SAMSON software platform for computational nanoscience (http://www.samson-connect.net). We validate both the automatic perception method and the UFF implementation on a series of benchmarks.},

  abstract = {The aim of computational molecular design is the identification of promising hypothetical molecules with a predefined set of desired properties. We address the issue of accelerating the material discovery with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The method involves two different types of prediction; the forward and backward predictions. The objective of the forward prediction is to create a set of machine learning models on various properties of a given molecule. Inverting the trained forward models through Bayes' law, we derive a posterior distribution for the backward prediction, which is conditioned by a desired property requirement. Exploring high-probability regions of the posterior with a sequential Monte Carlo technique, molecules that exhibit the desired properties can computationally be created. One major difficulty in the computational creation of molecules is the exclusion of the occurrence of chemically unfavorable structures. To circumvent this issue, we derive a chemical language model that acquires commonly occurring patterns of chemical fragments through natural language processing of ASCII strings of existing compounds, which follow the SMILES chemical language notation. In the backward prediction, the trained language model is used to refine chemical strings such that the properties of the resulting structures fall within the desired property region while chemically unfavorable structures are successfully removed. The present method is demonstrated through the design of small organic molecules with the property requirements on HOMO-LUMO gap and internal energy.

  abstract = {Molecular mechanics force fields are widely used in computer-aided drug design for the study of drug-like molecules alone or interacting with biological systems. In simulations involving biological macromolecules, the biological part is typically represented by a specialized biomolecular force field, while the drug is represented by a matching general (organic) force field. In order to apply these general force fields to an arbitrary drug-like molecule, functionality for assignment of atom types, parameters, and charges is required. In the present article, which is part I of a series of two, we present the algorithms for bond perception and atom typing for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). The CGenFF atom typer first associates attributes to the atoms and bonds in a molecule, such as valence, bond order, and ring membership among others. Of note are a number of features that are specifically required for CGenFF. This information is then used by the atom typing routine to assign CGenFF atom types based on a programmable decision tree. This allows for straightforward implementation of CGenFF's complicated atom typing rules and for equally straightforward updating of the atom typing scheme as the force field grows. The presented atom typer was validated by assigning correct atom types on 477 model compounds including in the training set as well as 126 test-set molecules that were constructed to specifically verify its different components. The program may be utilized via an online implementation at https://www.paramchem.org/.},

  abstract = {This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined ``organic/protein'' force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data\textemdash{}ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common ``functional group'' approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 {\AA} root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2$^\circ$ rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm-1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. \textcopyright{} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

For such large bimolecular systems, whether the RMSD or other alternative similarity measures might suffer from this ``curse'' and lose the ability to discriminate different macromolecular structures had not been explicitly addressed. Here, we show such dimensionality effects for both weighted and nonweighted RMSD schemes. We also provide a mechanism for the emergence of the ``curse of dimensionality'' for RMSD from the law of large numbers by showing that the conformational distributions from which RMSDs are calculated become increasingly similar as the system size increases. Our findings suggest the use of weighted RMSD schemes for small proteins (less than 200 residues) and nonweighted RMSD for larger proteins when analyzing molecular dynamics trajectories.},

  abstract = {DNA damage caused by oxidized bases can lead to aging and cancer in living beings. Luckily, a repair enzyme is able to repair the oxidized bases. The key step is to accurately recognize the oxidized bases, which mainly rely on complex hydrogen bond interactions. We have calibrated the charge parameters and torsional parameters of the ABEEM$\sigma\pi$ polarization force field (ABEEM$\sigma\pi$ PFF) to accurately describe the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Taking the experiment and quantum chemical method as the benchmark, a series of properties of base pair-amino acid residue systems, DNA and DNA\textendash{}protein interaction systems were calculated and compared with those of other force fields. We have done a tremendous amount of tasks in testing, calibrations, and analyses. The ABEEM$\sigma\pi$ PFF not only explicitly gives the position and the partial charge of lone-pair electrons but also introduces a function kHB to fit special electrostatic interactions in hydrogen bond interaction regions. Therefore, it can accurately simulate the polarization effect and charge transfer of hydrogen bond interactions, especially for charged systems and sulfur-containing systems, such as the binding energy between amino acid and base pairs (24\textendash{}28 kcal/mol), which is induced by charge transfer. The RMSD of ABEEM$\sigma\pi$ PFF is 1.18 kcal/mol, whereas the RMSD of Amber OL15 is 8.21 kcal/mol. The relative positions of the amino acid residue have significantly changed, and the hydrogen bonds were broken when simulated by fixed charge force fields. In addition, owing to refitting the reasonable torsional parameters, the geometric structures optimized by ABEEM$\sigma\pi$ PFF were well consistent with those of the M06-2X/6-311++G** method, but the simulations by fixed force fields have a large rotation of methyl and distortion of the plane of the base pair. After extensive MD simulation with four test DNAs and a DNA\textendash{}protein system, we conclude that ABEEM$\sigma\pi$ PFF shows better agreement when compared to experimental structures, which illustrates the reliability of our model and the transferability of the parameters.},

The variety of neural network types and their application to drug discovery requires expert knowledge to choose the most appropriate approach. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss traditional and newly emerging neural network approaches to drug discovery. Their focus is on backpropagation neural networks and their variants, self-organizing maps and associated methods, and a relatively new technique, deep learning. The most important technical issues are discussed including overfitting and its prevention through regularization, ensemble and multitask modeling, model interpretation, and estimation of applicability domain. Different aspects of using neural networks in drug discovery are considered: building structure-activity models with respect to various targets; predicting drug selectivity, toxicity profiles, ADMET and physicochemical properties; characteristics of drug-delivery systems and virtual screening. Expert opinion: Neural networks continue to grow in importance for drug discovery. Recent developments in deep learning suggests further improvements may be gained in the analysis of large chemical data sets. It's anticipated that neural networks will be more widely used in drug discovery in the future, and applied in non-traditional areas such as drug delivery systems, biologically compatible materials, and regenerative medicine.},

We utilize ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also propose a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular configurations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set, with root mean square errors as low as 0.56 kcal/mol.},

We incorporate local gradient information into the approximate posterior to sharpen it around the current batch statistics. This technique is not exclusive to recurrent neural networks and can be applied more widely to train Bayesian neural networks. We also empirically demonstrate how Bayesian RNNs are superior to traditional RNNs on a language modelling benchmark and an image captioning task, as well as showing how each of these methods improve our model over a variety of other schemes for training them.

The underlying algorithms, used over several decades, are designed for the application to general graphs. Applied on molecular graphs, little effort has been spend on characterizing their performance. Therefore, it is not clear how current substructure search algorithms behave on such special graphs. One of the main reasons why such an evaluation was not performed in the past was the absence of appropriate data sets.ResultsIn this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of Ullmann's and the VF2 subgraph isomorphism algorithms on molecular data. The benchmark set consists of a collection of 1235 SMARTS substructure expressions and selected molecules from the ZINC database. The benchmark evaluates substructures search times for complete database scans as well as individual substructure-molecule pairs. In detail, we focus on the influence of substructure formulation and size, the impact of molecule size, and the ability of both algorithms to be used on multiple cores.ConclusionsThe results show a clear superiority of the VF2 algorithm in all test scenarios. In general, both algorithms solve most instances in less than one millisecond, which we consider to be acceptable. Still, in direct comparison, the VF2 is most often several folds faster than Ullmann's algorithm. Additionally, Ullmann's algorithm shows a surprising number of run time outliers.Open image in new window},

  abstract = {We investigate uncertainty quantification under a sparse Bayesian model of medical image registration. Bayesian modelling has proven powerful to automate the tuning of registration hyperparameters, such as the trade-off between the data and regularization functionals. Sparsity-inducing priors have recently been used to render the parametrization itself adaptive and data-driven. The sparse prior on transformation parameters effectively favors the use of coarse basis functions to capture the global trends in the visible motion while finer, highly localized bases are introduced only in the presence of coherent image information and motion. In earlier work, approximate inference under the sparse Bayesian model was tackled in an efficient Variational Bayes (VB) framework. In this paper we are interested in the theoretical and empirical quality of uncertainty estimates derived under this approximate scheme vs. under the exact model. We implement an (asymptotically) exact inference scheme based on reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to characterize the posterior distribution of the transformation and compare the predictions of the VB and MCMC based methods. The true posterior distribution under the sparse Bayesian model is found to be meaningful: orders of magnitude for the estimated uncertainty are quantitatively reasonable, the uncertainty is higher in textureless regions and lower in the direction of strong intensity gradients.},

  abstract = {Binding selectivity is a requirement for the development of a safe drug, and it is a critical property for chemical probes used in preclinical target validation. Engineering selectivity adds considerable complexity to the rational design of new drugs, as it involves the optimization of multiple binding affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding selectivity is a challenge, and generally applicable methodologies are still not available to the computational and medicinal chemistry communities. Absolute binding free energy calculations based on alchemical pathways provide a rigorous framework for affinity predictions and could thus offer a general approach to the problem. We evaluated the performance of free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics for the prediction of selectivity by estimating the affinity profile of three bromodomain inhibitors across multiple bromodomain families, and by comparing the results to isothermal titration calorimetry data. Two case studies were considered. In the first one, the affinities of two similar ligands for seven bromodomains were calculated and returned excellent agreement with experiment (mean unsigned error of 0.81 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.75). In this test case, we also show how the preferred binding orientation of a ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free energy calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated and returned a more modest accuracy (mean unsigned error of 1.76 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.48); however, the reparametrization of a sulfonamide moiety improved the agreement with experiment.},

Multipoles through the quadrupole are assigned to each atomic center based on a distributed multipole analysis (DMA) derived from large basis set molecular orbital calculations on the water monomer. Polarization is treated via self-consistent induced atomic dipoles. A modified version of Thole's interaction model is used to damp induction at short range. Repulsion-dispersion (vdW) effects are computed from a buffered 14-7 potential. In a departure from most current water potentials, we find that significant vdW parameters are necessary on hydrogen as well as oxygen. The new potential is fully flexible and has been tested versus a variety of experimental data and quantum calculations for small clusters, liquid water, and ice. Overall, excellent agreement with experimental and high level ab initio results is obtained for numerous properties, including cluster structures and energetics and bulk thermodynamic and structural measures. The parametrization scheme described here is easily extended to other molecular systems, and the resulting water potential should provide a useful explicit solvent model for organic solutes and biopolymer modeling.},

  abstract = {A protocol is described for the treatment of molecular polarization in force field calculations. The resulting model is consistent in that both inter- and intramolecular polarization are handled within a single scheme. An analytical formula for removing intramolecular polarization from a set of atomic multipoles for an arbitrary static structure or conformation is given. With the help of the intramolecular polarization, these permanent atomic multipoles can then be applied in modeling alternative conformations of a molecule. Equipped with this simple technique, one can derive transferable electrostatic parameters for peptides and proteins using flexible model compounds such as dipeptides. The proposed procedure is tested for its ability to describe the electrostatic potential around various configurations of the N-methylacetamide dimer. The effect of different intramolecular polarization schemes on the accuracy of a force field model of the electrostatic potential of alanine dipeptide is investigated. A group-based scheme for including direct intramolecular polarization is shown to be most successful in accounting for the conformational dependence of electrostatic potentials. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These gas-to-water transfer free energies have in the past proven a valuable test of a variety of computational methods and force fields. Here, in contrast to some previous SAMPL challenges, we find a relatively wide range of methods perform quite well on this test set, with RMS errors in the 1.2~kcal/mol range for several of the best performing methods. Top-performers included a quantum mechanical approach with continuum solvent models and functional group corrections, alchemical molecular dynamics simulations with a classical all-atom force field, and a single-conformation Poisson-Boltzmann approach. While 1.2~kcal/mol is still a significant error, experimental hydration free energies covered a range of nearly 20~kcal/mol, so methods typically showed substantial predictive power. Here, a substantial new focus was on evaluation of error estimates, as predicting when a computational prediction is reliable versus unreliable has considerable practical value. We found, however, that in many cases errors are substantially underestimated, and that typically little effort has been invested in estimating likely error. We believe this is an important area for further research.},

This focused set of molecules were then provided as a blinded challenge to assess the ability of current computational solvation methods to accurately model the interactions between water and increasingly chlorinated compounds. This was presented as part of the SAMPL3 challenge, which represented the fourth iterative blind prediction challenge involving transfer energies. The results of this exercise demonstrate that the field in general has difficulty predicting the transfer energies of more highly chlorinated compounds, and that methods seem to be erring in the same direction.},

We demonstrate this accuracy for AIMD trajectories of molecules, including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, ethanol, uracil, and aspirin. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished in our work by learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. The GDML approach enables quantitative molecular dynamics simulations for molecules at a fraction of cost of explicit AIMD calculations, thereby allowing the construction of efficient force fields with the accuracy and transferability of high-level ab initio methods.},

Rigorous uncertainty estimates are generated by Metropolis-Hastings sampling from the Bayes posterior. We also report a means to project the FES and its uncertainties into arbitrary auxiliary order parameters beyond those in which biased sampling was conducted. We demonstrate the approaches in applications of alanine dipeptide and the unthreading of a synthetic mimic of the astexin-3 lasso peptide.

In this perspective, we address the types of errors that might arise in atomistic machine learning, the unique aspects of atomistic simulations that make machine-learning challenging, and highlight how uncertainty analysis can be used to assess the validity of machine-learning predictions. We suggest this will allow researchers to more fully use machine learning for the routine acceleration of large, high-accuracy, or extended-time simulations. In our demonstrations, we use a bootstrap ensemble of neural network-based calculators, and show that the width of the ensemble can provide an estimate of the uncertainty when the width is comparable to that in the training data. Intriguingly, we also show that the uncertainty can be localized to specific atoms in the simulation, which may offer hints for the generation of training data to strategically improve the machine-learned representation.},

Distribution coefficients (log D) replace the hydration free energies that were a central part of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of computational methods were represented by the 76 submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics and provide details for a number of reference calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4 challenge, we assessed the ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty, but their model uncertainty\textemdash{}how well they can predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around 1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge provided great insight into the importance of modeling a variety of physical effects. We believe these types of measurements will be a promising source of data for future blind challenges, especially in view of the relatively straightforward nature of the experiments and the level of insight provided.},

Furthermore, parameters obtained in gas phase are substantiated in liquid-phase simulations. The hydration free energy (HFE) of neutral and charged molecules have been calculated and compared with experimental values. The RMS error for the HFE of neutral molecules is less than 1 kcal/mol. Meanwhile, the relative error in the predicted HFE of salts (cations and anions) is less than 3\% with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. Overall, the performance of Poltype is satisfactory and provides a convenient utility for applications such as drug discovery. Further improvement can be achieved by the systematic study of various organic compounds, particularly ionic molecules, and refinement and expansion of the parameter database.},

  abstract = {While the use of machine-learning (ML) techniques is well established in cheminformatics for the prediction of physicochemical properties and binding affinities, the training of ML models based on data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a fingerprint termed MDFP which is constructed from the distributions of properties such as potential-energy components, radius of gyration, and solvent-accessible surface area extracted from MD simulations. The corresponding fingerprint elements are the first two statistical moments of the distributions and the median. By considering not only the average but also the spread of the distribution in the fingerprint, some degree of entropic information is encoded. Short MD simulations of the molecules in water (and in vacuum) are used to generate MDFP. These are further combined with simple counts based on the 2D structure of the molecules into MDFP+. The resulting information-rich MDFP+ is used to train ML models for the prediction of solvation free energies in five different solvents (water, octanol, chloroform, hexadecane, and cyclohexane) as well as partition coefficients in octanol/water, hexadecane/water, and cyclohexane/water. The approach is easy to implement and computationally relatively inexpensive. Yet, it performs similarly well compared to more rigorous MD-based free-energy methods such as free-energy perturbation (FEP) as well as end-state methods such as linear interaction energy (LIE), the conductor-like screening model for realistic solvation (COSMO-RS), and the SMx family of solvation models.},
