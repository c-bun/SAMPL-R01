  abstract = {Molecular containers such as cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and the octa-acid (OA) host are ideal simplified model test systems for optimizing and analyzing methods for computing free energies of binding intended for use with biologically relevant protein\textendash{}ligand complexes. To this end, we have performed initially blind free energy calculations to determine the free energies of binding for ligands of both the CB7 and OA hosts. A subset of the selected guest molecules were those included in the SAMPL4 prediction challenge. Using expanded ensemble simulations in the dimension of coupling host\textendash{}guest intermolecular interactions, we are able to show that our estimates in most cases can be demonstrated to fully converge and that the errors in our estimates are due almost entirely to the assigned force field parameters and the choice of environmental conditions used to model experiment. We confirm the convergence through the use of alternative simulation methodologies and thermodynamic pathways, analyzing sampled conformations, and directly observing changes of the free energy with respect to simulation time. Our results demonstrate the benefits of enhanced sampling of multiple local free energy minima made possible by the use of expanded ensemble molecular dynamics and may indicate the presence of significant problems with current transferable force fields for organic molecules when used for calculating binding affinities, especially in non-protein chemistries.},

  abstract = {Accurate methods for predicting protein\textendash{}ligand binding affinities are of central interest to computer-aided drug design for hit identification and lead optimization. Here, we used the mining minima (M2) method to predict cucurbit[7]uril binding affinities from the SAMPL4 blind prediction challenge. We tested two different energy models, an empirical classical force field, CHARMm with VCharge charges, and the Poisson\textendash{}Boltzmann surface area solvation model; and a semiempirical quantum mechanical (QM) Hamiltonian, PM6-DH+, coupled with the COSMO solvation model and a surface area term for nonpolar solvation free energy. Binding affinities based on the classical force field correlated strongly with the experiments with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.74. On the other hand, binding affinities based on the QM energy model correlated poorly with experiments (R2 = 0.24), due largely to two major outliers. As we used extensive conformational search methods, these results point to possible inaccuracies in the PM6-DH+ energy model or the COSMO solvation model. Furthermore, the different binding free energy components, solute energy, solvation free energy, and configurational entropy showed significant deviations between the classical M2 and quantum M2 calculations. Comparison of different classical M2 free energy components to experiments show that the change in the total energy, i.e. the solute energy plus the solvation free energy, is the key driving force for binding, with a reasonable correlation to experiment (R2 = 0.56); however, accounting for configurational entropy further improves the correlation.},

  abstract = {We used the second-generation mining minima method (M2) to compute the binding affinities of the novel host\textendash{}guest complexes in the SAMPL3 blind prediction challenge. The predictions were in poor agreement with experiment, and we conjectured that much of the error might derive from the force field, CHARMm with Vcharge charges. Repeating the calculations with other generalized force-fields led to no significant improvement, and we observed that the predicted affinities were highly sensitive to the choice of force-field. We therefore embarked on a systematic evaluation of a set of generalized force fields, based upon comparisons with PM6-DH2, a fast yet accurate semi-empirical quantum mechanics method. In particular, we compared gas-phase interaction energies and entropies for the host\textendash{}guest complexes themselves, as well as for smaller chemical fragments derived from the same molecules. The mean deviations of the force field interaction energies from the quantum results were greater than 3 kcal/mol and 9 kcal/mol, for the fragments and host\textendash{}guest systems respectively. We further evaluated the accuracy of force-fields for computing the vibrational entropies and found the mean errors to be greater than 4 kcal/mol. Given these errors in energy and entropy, it is not surprising in retrospect that the predicted binding affinities deviated from the experiment by several kcal/mol. These results emphasize the need for improvements in generalized force-fields and also highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of force-field parameters prior to evaluating different free-energy methods.},

  abstract = {We have estimated free energies for the binding of nine cyclic carboxylate guest molecules to the octa-acid host in the SAMPL4 blind-test challenge with four different approaches. First, we used standard free-energy perturbation calculations of relative binding affinities, performed at the molecular-mechanics (MM) level with TIP3P waters, the GAFF force field, and two different sets of charges for the host and the guest, obtained either with the restrained electrostatic potential or AM1-BCC methods. Both charge sets give good and nearly identical results, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 4 kJ/mol and a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.8 compared to experimental results. Second, we tried to improve these predictions with 28,800 density-functional theory (DFT) calculations for selected snapshots and the non-Boltzmann Bennett acceptance-ratio method, but this led to much worse results, probably because of a too large difference between the MM and DFT potential-energy functions. Third, we tried to calculate absolute affinities using minimised DFT structures. This gave intermediate-quality results with MADs of 5\textendash{}9 kJ/mol and R2 = 0.6\textendash{}0.8, depending on how the structures were obtained. Finally, we tried to improve these results using local coupled-cluster calculations with single and double excitations, and non-iterative perturbative treatment of triple excitations (LCCSD(T0)), employing the polarisable multipole interactions with supermolecular pairs approach. Unfortunately, this only degraded the predictions, probably because of a mismatch between the solvation energies obtained at the DFT and LCCSD(T0) levels.},

To calculate the solvation free energy of a simple ion, it is essential to take into account the polarization of nearby solvent but also the electrostatic potential drop across the liquid\textendash{}gas boundary, however distant. The latter does not exist in a simulation model based on periodic boundary conditions because there is no physical boundary to the system. An important consequence is that the reference value of the electrostatic potential is not an ion in a vacuum. Also, in an infinite system, the electrostatic potential felt by a perturbing charge is conditionally convergent and dependent on the choice of computational conventions. Furthermore, with Ewald lattice summation and tinfoil conducting boundary conditions, the charges experience a spurious shift in the potential that depends on the details of the simulation system such as the volume fraction occupied by the solvent. All these issues can be handled with established computational protocols, as reviewed here and illustrated for several small ions and three solvated proteins.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting binding affinities between ligands and macromolecules has been a much sought-after goal. A tremendous amount of resources can be saved in the pharmaceutical industry through accurate binding-affinity prediction and hence correct decision-making for the drug discovery processes. Owing to the structural complexity of macromolecules, one of the issues in binding affinity prediction using molecular dynamics is the adequate sampling of the conformational space. Recently, the funnel metadynamics method (Limongelli et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110:6358, 2013) was developed to enhance the sampling of the ligand at the binding site as well as in the solvated state, and offer the possibility to predict the absolute binding free energy. We apply funnel metadynamics to predict host\textendash{}guest binding affinities for the cucurbit[7]uril host as part of the SAMPL4 blind challenge. Using total simulation times of 300\textendash{}400 ns per ligand, we show that the errors due to inadequate sampling are below 1 kcal/mol. However, despite the large investment in terms of computational time, the results compared to experiment are not better than a random guess. As we obtain differences of up to 11 kcal/mol when switching between two commonly used force fields (with automatically generated parameters), we strongly believe that in the pursuit of accurate binding free energies a more careful force-field parametrization is needed to address this type of system.},

  abstract = {Conformational change in protein\textendash{}ligand complexes is widely modeled, but the protein accommodation expected on binding a congeneric series of ligands has received less attention. Given their use in medicinal chemistry, there are surprisingly few substantial series of congeneric ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we determine the structures of eight alkyl benzenes, in single-methylene increases from benzene to n-hexylbenzene, bound to an enclosed cavity in T4 lysozyme. The volume of the apo cavity suffices to accommodate benzene but, even with toluene, larger cavity conformations become observable in the electron density, and over the series two other major conformations are observed. These involve discrete changes in main-chain conformation, expanding the site; few continuous changes in the site are observed. In most structures, two discrete protein conformations are observed simultaneously, and energetic considerations suggest that these conformations are low in energy relative to the ground state. An analysis of 121 lysozyme cavity structures in the PDB finds that these three conformations dominate the previously determined structures, largely modeled in a single conformation. An investigation of the few congeneric series in the PDB suggests that discrete changes are common adaptations to a series of growing ligands. The discrete, but relatively few, conformational states observed here, and their energetic accessibility, may have implications for anticipating protein conformational change in ligand design.},

  abstract = {We present a method to identify small molecule ligand binding sites and poses within a given protein crystal structure using GPU-accelerated Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The Hamiltonians used vary from the physical end state of protein interacting with the ligand to an unphysical end state where the ligand does not interact with the protein. As replicas explore the space of Hamiltonians interpolating between these states, the ligand can rapidly escape local minima and explore potential binding sites. Geometric restraints keep the ligands from leaving the vicinity of the protein and an alchemical pathway designed to increase phase space overlap between intermediates ensures good mixing. Because of the rigorous statistical mechanical nature of the Hamiltonian exchange framework, we can also extract binding free energy estimates for all putative binding sites. We present results of this methodology applied to the T4 lysozyme L99A model system for three known ligands and one non-binder as a control, using an implicit solvent. We find that our methodology identifies known crystallographic binding sites consistently and accurately for the small number of ligands considered here and gives free energies consistent with experiment. We are also able to analyze the contribution of individual binding sites to the overall binding affinity. Our methodology points to near term potential applications in early-stage structure-guided drug discovery.},

  abstract = {We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4 lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol. In addition, we computed "relative" binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment was 2.0 A (diverse set), 1.8 A (phenol-derived predictions), and 1.2 A (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based absolute binding free energy methods.},

  abstract = {Here, we computed the aqueous solvation (hydration) free energies of 52 small drug-like molecules using an all-atom force field in explicit water. This differs from previous studies in that (1) this was a blind test (in an event called SAMPL sponsored by OpenEye Software) and (2) the test compounds were considerably more challenging than have been used in the past in typical solvation tests of all-atom models. Overall, we found good correlations with experimental values which were subsequently made available, but the variances are large compared to those in previous tests. We tested several different charge models and found that several standard charge models performed relatively well. We found that hypervalent sulfur and phosphorus compounds are not well handled using current force field parameters and suggest several other possible systematic errors. Overall, blind tests like these appear to provide significant opportunities for improving force fields and solvent models.},

  abstract = {A central challenge in structure-based ligand design is the accurate prediction of binding free energies. Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.},

  doi = {10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00934},
  abstract = {Here, our interest is in predicting solubility in general, and we focus particularly on predicting how the solubility of particular solutes is modulated by the solvent environment. Solubility in general is extremely important, both for theoretical reasons - it provides an important probe of the balance between solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions - and for more practical reasons, such as how to control the solubility of a given solute via modulation of its environment, as in process chemistry and separations. Here, we study how the change of solvent affects the solubility of a given compound. That is, we calculate relative solubilities. We use MD simulations to calculate relative solubility and compare our calculated values with experiment as well as with results from several other methods, SMD and UNIFAC, the latter of which is commonly used in chemical engineering design. We find that straightforward solubility calculations based on molecular simulations using a general small-molecule force field outperform SMD and UNIFAC both in terms of accuracy and coverage of the relevant chemical space.},

We tested two different solvent models, TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew, and obtained very similar hydration free energies for these two models; the RMS difference was 0.64 kcal/mol. We found that preferred conformation of the carboxylic acids in water differs from that in vacuum. Surprisingly, this conformational change is not adequately sampled on simulation timescales, so we apply an umbrella sampling technique to include free energies associated with the conformational change. Overall, the results of this test reveal that the force field parameters for some groups of molecules (such as hydroxyl-rich compounds) still need to be improved, but for most compounds, accuracy was consistent with that seen in our previous tests.},

  abstract = {Hydration free energy calculations have become important tests of force fields. Alchemical free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations provide a rigorous way to calculate these free energies for a particular force field, given sufficient sampling. Here, we report results of alchemical hydration free energy calculations for the set of small molecules comprising the 2011 Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands challenge. Our calculations are largely based on the Generalized Amber Force Field with several different charge models, and we achieved RMS errors in the 1.4-2.2 kcal/mol range depending on charge model, marginally higher than what we typically observed in previous studies (Mobley et al. in J Phys Chem B 111(9):2242-2254, 2007, J Chem Theory Comput 5(2):350-358, 2009, J Phys Chem B 115:1329-1332, 2011; Nicholls et al. in J Med Chem 51:769-779, 2008; Klimovich and Mobley in J Comput Aided Mol Design 24(4):307-316, 2010). The test set consists of ethane, biphenyl, and a dibenzyl dioxin, as well as a series of chlorinated derivatives of each. We found that, for this set, using high-quality partial charges from MP2/cc-PVTZ SCRF RESP fits provided marginally improved agreement with experiment over using AM1-BCC partial charges as we have more typically done, in keeping with our recent findings (Mobley et al. in J Phys Chem B 115:1329-1332, 2011). Switching to OPLS Lennard-Jones parameters with AM1-BCC charges also improves agreement with experiment. We also find a number of chemical trends within each molecular series which we can explain, but there are also some surprises, including some that are captured by the calculations and some that are not.},

These rates can be estimated using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model, which requires calculation of the potential of mean force and position-dependent diffusivity of the solute along the transmembrane axis. In this paper, we assess the efficiency and accuracy of several methods for the calculation of the permeability of a model DMPC bilayer to urea, benzoic acid, and codeine. We compare umbrella sampling, replica exchange umbrella sampling, adaptive biasing force, and multiple-walker adaptive biasing force for the calculation of the transmembrane PMF. No definitive advantage for any of these methods in their ability to predict the membrane permeability coefficient Pm was found, provided that a sufficiently long equilibration is performed. For diffusivities, a Bayesian inference method was compared to a generalized Langevin method, both being sensitive to chosen parameters and the slow relaxation of membrane defects. Agreement within 1.5 log units of the computed Pm with experiment is found for all permeants and methods. Remaining discrepancies can likely be attributed to limitations of the force field as well as slowly relaxing collective movements within the lipid environment. Numerical calculations based on model profiles show that Pm can be reliably estimated from only a few data points, leading to recommendations for calculating Pm from simulations.},

Low molecular weight receptors and their ligands\textemdash{}i.e., host\textendash{}guest systems\textemdash{}represent valuable test-beds for such affinity prediction methods, because their small size makes for fast calculations and relatively facile numerical convergence. The SAMPL3 community exercise included the first ever blind prediction challenge for host\textendash{}guest binding affinities, through the incorporation of 11 new host\textendash{}guest complexes. Ten participating research groups addressed this challenge with a variety of approaches. Statistical assessment indicates that, although most methods performed well at predicting some general trends in binding affinity, overall accuracy was not high, as all the methods suffered from either poor correlation or high RMS errors or both. There was no clear advantage in using explicit versus implicit solvent models, any particular force field, or any particular approach to conformational sampling. In a few cases, predictions using very similar energy models but different sampling and/or free-energy methods resulted in significantly different results. The protonation states of one host and some guest molecules emerged as key uncertainties beyond the choice of computational approach. The present results have implications for methods development and future blind prediction exercises.},

  abstract = {Molecular docking is a powerful tool used in drug discovery and structural biology for predicting the structures of ligand\textendash{}receptor complexes. However, the accuracy of docking calculations can be limited by factors such as the neglect of protein reorganization in the scoring function; as a result, ligand screening can produce a high rate of false positive hits. Although absolute binding free energy methods still have difficulty in accurately rank-ordering binders, we believe that they can be fruitfully employed to distinguish binders from nonbinders and reduce the false positive rate. Here we study a set of ligands that dock favorably to a newly discovered, potentially allosteric site on the flap of HIV-1 protease. Fragment binding to this site stabilizes a closed form of protease, which could be exploited for the design of allosteric inhibitors. Twenty-three top-ranked protein\textendash{}ligand complexes from AutoDock were subject to the free energy screening using two methods, the recently developed binding energy analysis method (BEDAM) and the standard double decoupling method (DDM). Free energy calculations correctly identified most of the false positives ($\geq$83\%) and recovered all the confirmed binders. The results show a gap averaging $\geq$3.7 kcal/mol, separating the binders and the false positives. We present a formula that decomposes the binding free energy into contributions from the receptor conformational macrostates, which provides insights into the roles of different binding modes. Our binding free energy component analysis further suggests that improving the treatment for the desolvation penalty associated with the unfulfilled polar groups could reduce the rate of false positive hits in docking. The current study demonstrates that the combination of docking with free energy methods can be very useful for more accurate ligand screening against valuable drug targets.},

  abstract = {An important unsolved problem in materials science is prediction of the thermodynamic stability of organic crystals and their solubility from first principles. Solubility can be defined as the saturating concentration of a molecule within a liquid solvent, where the physical picture is of solvated molecules in equilibrium with their solid phase. Despite the importance of solubility in determining the oral bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, prediction tools are currently limited to quantitative structure\textendash{}property relationships that are fit to experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a consistent procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals from molecular dynamics simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. Our approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the sum of solid\textendash{}vapor sublimation and vapor\textendash{}liquid solvation free energies $\Delta$Gsolubility$^\circ$ = $\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ + $\Delta$Gsolv$^\circ$, which are computed via the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to the n-alkylamides series from acetamide through octanamide was selected due to the dependence of their solubility on both amide hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein structure and solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard state solubility free energies are accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The experimental trend of decreasing solubility as a function of n-alkylamide chain length is recapitulated by the increasing stability of the crystalline state and to a lesser degree by decreasing favorability of solvation (i.e., the hydrophobic effect). Our results suggest that coupling the polarizable AMOEBA force field with an orthogonal space based free energy algorithm, as implemented in the program Force Field X, is a consistent procedure for predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of organic crystals.},

Here, we describe progress toward an alternative scheme based on growth of the asymmetric unit into a crystal via alchemy (GAUCHE). GAUCHE computes deposition free energy $\Delta$Gdep$^\circ$ = -$\Delta$Gsub$^\circ$ = -kBT ln(Vc/Vg) + $\Delta$GAU + $\Delta$GAU$\rightarrow$UC as the sum of an entropic term to account for compressing a vapor at 1 M standard state (Vg) into the molar volume of the crystal (Vc), where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin, plus two simulation steps. In the first simulation step, the deposition free energy $\Delta$GAU for a system composed of only NAU asymmetric unit (AU) molecule(s) is computed beginning from an arbitrary conformation in vacuum. In the second simulation step, the change in free energy $\Delta$GAU$\rightarrow$UC to expand the asymmetric unit degrees of freedom into a unit cell (UC) composed of NUC independent molecules is computed. This latter step accounts for the favorable free energy of removing the constraint that every symmetry mate of the asymmetric unit has an identical conformation and intermolecular interactions. The current work is based on NVT simulations, which requires knowledge of the crystal space group and unit cell parameters from experiment, but not a priori knowledge of crystalline atomic coordinates. GAUCHE was applied to 5 organic molecules whose sublimation free energy has been measured experimentally, based on the polarizable AMOEBA force field and more than a microsecond of sampling per compound in the program Force Field X. The mean unsigned and RMS errors were only 1.6 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicates that GAUCHE is capable of accurate prediction of absolute sublimation thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {As the free energy of binding of a ligand to its target is one of the crucial optimization parameters in drug design, its accurate prediction is highly desirable. In the present study we have assessed the average accuracy of free energy calculations for a total of 92 ligands binding to five different targets. To make this study and future larger scale applications possible we automated the setup procedure. Starting from user defined binding modes, the procedure decides which ligands to connect via a perturbation based on maximum common substructure criteria and produces all necessary parameter files for free energy calculations in AMBER 11. For the systems investigated, errors due to insufficient sampling were found to be substantial in some cases whereas differences in estimators (thermodynamic integration (TI) versus multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR)) were found to be negligible. Analytical uncertainty estimates calculated from a single free energy calculation were found to be much smaller than the sample standard deviation obtained from two independent free energy calculations. Agreement with experiment was found to be system dependent ranging from excellent to mediocre (RMSE = [0.9, 8.2, 4.7, 5.7, 8.7] kJ/mol). When restricting analyses to free energy calculations with sample standard deviations below 1 kJ/mol agreement with experiment improved (RMSE = [0.8, 6.9, 1.8, 3.9, 5.6] kJ/mol).},

  abstract = {The emergence of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations is the major problem against AIDS treatment. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and free energy (MM\textendash{}PBSA and thermodynamic integration) analyses on wild-type (WT) and mutated HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) complexes with darunavir, amprenavir, indinavir, and saquinavir to clarify the mechanism of resistance due to the I50V flap mutation. Conformational analysis showed that the protease flaps are increasingly flexible in the I50V complexes. In the WT, stabilization of the HIV-1 PR structure is achieved via interflap and water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions between the flaps. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds between drugs and binding cavity residues (Asp29/29${'}$/30/30${'}$) are crucial for effective inhibition. All these interactions were significantly diminished (or absent) in the mutated forms, thus denoting their importance toward binding. Thermodynamic integration calculations reproduced the experimental data to within $\approx$1 kcal mol\textendash{}1 and showed that the I50V mutation results in weaker binding free energies for all analyzed complexes with respect to the WT. It was observed that the loss in binding energy upon mutation was mostly enthalpically driven in all complexes, with the greatest effect coming from the reduction of van der Waals interactions. Our results motivated us to test two novel compounds that have been synthesized to maximize interactions with HIV-1 PR. MM\textendash{}PBSA and TI calculations showed that compound 3c (Ghosh et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 22, 2308) is a promising protease inhibitor, which presents very effective binding to the WT PR ($\Delta$GMM\textendash{}PBSA = -17.2 kcal mol\textendash{}1, $\Delta$Gexp = -16.1 kcal mol\textendash{}1). Upon I50V mutation, the complex binding free energy was weakened by a $\Delta\Delta$GTI of 1.8 kcal mol\textendash{}1, comparable to the marketed inhibitors. This predicts that I50V may confer low resistance to 3c. This computational comparative study contributes toward elucidation of the I50V drug-resistance mechanism in HIV-1 PR.},

Employing 20-{\AA} truncated spherical systems and only one intermediate state in the perturbations, we obtain an error of less than 4 kJ/mol for 54\% of the studied relative affinities and a precision of 0.5 kJ/mol on average. However, only four of the proteins gave acceptable errors, correlations, and rankings. The results could be improved by using nine intermediate states in the simulations or including the entire protein in the simulations using periodic boundary conditions. However, 27 of the calculated affinities still gave errors of more than 4 kJ/mol, and for three of the proteins the results were not satisfactory. This shows that the performance of BAR calculations depends on the target protein and that several transformations gave poor results owing to limitations in the molecular-mechanics force field or the restricted sampling possible within a reasonable simulation time. Still, the BAR results are better than docking calculations for most of the proteins.},

However, the performance of existing computationally demanding binding free energy calculation methods in this context is largely unknown. We analyzed the performance of the molecular mechanics continuum solvent, the linear interaction energy (LIE), and the thermodynamic integration (TI) approach for three sets of compounds from industrial lead optimization projects. The data sets pose challenges typical for this early stage of drug discovery. None of the methods was sufficiently predictive when applied out of the box without considering these challenges. Detailed investigations of failures revealed critical points that are essential for good binding free energy predictions. When data set-specific features were considered accordingly, predictions valuable for lead optimization could be obtained for all approaches but LIE. Our findings lead to clear recommendations for when to use which of the above approaches. Our findings also stress the important role of expert knowledge in this process, not least for estimating the accuracy of prediction results by TI, using indicators such as the size and chemical structure of exchanged groups and the statistical error in the predictions. Such knowledge will be invaluable when it comes to the question which of the TI results can be trusted for decision making.},

The computational protocol leveraged docking and high level atomistic models to improve enrichment. The enrichment factor of our blind predictions ranked best among all of the computational submissions, and second best overall. This work represents to our knowledge the first example of the application of an all-atom physics-based binding free energy model to large scale virtual screening. A total of 285 parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics absolute protein-ligand binding free energy simulations were conducted starting from docked poses. The setup of the simulations was fully automated, calculations were distributed on multiple computing resources and were completed in a 6-weeks period. The accuracy of the docked poses and the inclusion of intramolecular strain and entropic losses in the binding free energy estimates were the major factors behind the success of the method. Lack of sufficient time and computing resources to investigate additional protonation states of the ligands was a major cause of mispredictions. The experiment demonstrated the applicability of binding free energy modeling to improve hit rates in challenging virtual screening of focused ligand libraries during lead optimization.},

Since the discovery of the first CBn, CB6, the field has seen tremendous growth with respect to the synthesis of new homologues and derivatives, the discovery of record binding affinities of guest molecules in their hydrophobic cavity, and associated applications ranging from sensing to drug delivery.

We use an explicit-water model to precompute properties of water solvation shells around simple spheres, then assemble a solute's solvation shell by combining the shells of these spheres. SEA improves upon implicit-solvent models of solvation free energies by accounting for local solute curvature, accounting for near-neighbor nonadditivities, and treating water's dipole as being asymmetrical with respect to positive or negative solute charges. SEA does not involve parameter fitting, because parameters come from the given underlying explicit-solvation model. SEA is about as accurate as explicit simulations as shown by comparisons against four different homologous alkyl series, a set of 504 varied solutes, solutes taken retrospectively from two solvation-prediction events, and a hypothetical polar-solute series, and SEA is about 100-fold faster than Poisson\textendash{}Boltzmann calculations.},

  abstract = {Here, we test a method, called semi-explicit assembly (SEA), that computes the solvation free energies of molecules in water in the SAMPL4 blind test challenge. SEA was developed with the intention of being as accurate as explicit-solvent models, but much faster to compute. It is accurate because it uses pre-simulations of simple spheres in explicit solvent to obtain structural and thermodynamic quantities, and it is fast because it parses solute free energies into regionally additive quantities. SAMPL4 provided us the opportunity to make new tests of SEA. Our tests here lead us to the following conclusions: (1) The newest version, called Field-SEA, which gives improved predictions for highly charged ions, is shown here to perform as well as the earlier versions (dipolar and quadrupolar SEA) on this broad blind SAMPL4 test set. (2) We find that both the past and present SEA models give solvation free energies that are as accurate as TIP3P. (3) Using a new approach for force field parameter optimization, we developed improved hydroxyl parameters that ensure consistency with neat-solvent dielectric constants, and found that they led to improved solvation free energies for hydroxyl-containing compounds in SAMPL4. We also learned that these hydroxyl parameters are not just fixing solvent exposed oxygens in a general sense, and therefore do not improve predictions for carbonyl or carboxylic-acid groups. Other such functional groups will need their own independent optimizations for potential improvements. Overall, these tests in SAMPL4 indicate that SEA is an accurate, general and fast new approach to computing solvation free energies.},

Accurate estimations of transfer between phases with significantly different polarities can be difficult because of the static nature of the force fields. Here, we report on an application of such calculations in the SAMPL5 experiment that also involves an effort in balancing solute and solvent interactions via their expected static dielectric constants. This strategy performs well with respect to predictive accuracy and correlation with unknown experimental values. We follow this by performing a series of retrospective investigations which highlight the potential importance of proper balancing in these systems, and we use a null hypothesis analysis to explore potential biases in the comparisons with experiment. The collective findings indicate that considerations of force field compatibility through dielectric behavior is a potential strategy for future improvements in transfer processes between disparate environments.},

  abstract = {We predict cyclohexane\textendash{}water distribution coefficients (log D7.4) for drug-like molecules taken from the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge by the ``embedded cluster reference interaction site model'' (EC-RISM) integral equation theory. This task involves the coupled problem of predicting both partition coefficients (log P) of neutral species between the solvents and aqueous acidity constants (pKa) in order to account for a change of protonation states. The first issue is addressed by calibrating an EC-RISM-based model for solvation free energies derived from the ``Minnesota Solvation Database'' (MNSOL) for both water and cyclohexane utilizing a correction based on the partial molar volume, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.4 kcal mol-1 for water and 0.8\textendash{}0.9 kcal mol-1 for cyclohexane depending on the parametrization. The second one is treated by employing on one hand an empirical pKa model (MoKa) and, on the other hand, an EC-RISM-derived regression of published acidity constants (RMSE of 1.5 for a single model covering acids and bases). In total, at most 8 adjustable parameters are necessary (2\textendash{}3 for each solvent and two for the pKa) for training solvation and acidity models. Applying the final models to the log D7.4 dataset corresponds to evaluating an independent test set comprising other, composite observables, yielding, for different cyclohexane parametrizations, 2.0\textendash{}2.1 for the RMSE with the first and 2.2\textendash{}2.8 with the combined first and second SAMPL5 data set batches. Notably, a pure log P model (assuming neutral species only) performs statistically similarly for these particular compounds. The nature of the approximations and possible perspectives for future developments are discussed.},

We use our predictions of the distribution coefficients between water and cyclohexane from the SAMPL5 challenge to estimate the hydrophobicity of different explicit solvent simulation techniques. Based on molecular dynamics trajectories with the CHARMM General Force Field, we compare pure molecular mechanics (MM) with quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations based on QM/MM schemes that treat the solvent at the MM level. We perform QM/MM with both density functional theory (BLYP) and semi-empirical methods (OM1, OM2, OM3, PM3). The calculations also serve to test the sensitivity of partition coefficients to solute polarizability as well as the interplay of the quantum-mechanical region with the fixed-charge molecular mechanics environment. Our results indicate that QM/MM with both BLYP and OM2 outperforms pure MM. However, this observation is limited to a subset of cases where convergence of the free energy can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Implicit solvent methods for classical molecular modeling are frequently used to provide fast, physics-based hydration free energies of macromolecules. Less commonly considered is the transferability of these methods to other solvents. The Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands 5 (SAMPL5) distribution coefficient dataset and the accompanying explicit solvent partition coefficient reference calculations provide a direct test of solvent model transferability. Here we use the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) statistical-mechanical solvation theory, with a well tested water model and a new united atom cyclohexane model, to calculate partition coefficients for the SAMPL5 dataset. The cyclohexane model performed well in training and testing (R=0.98R=0.98 for amino acid neutral side chain analogues) but only if a parameterized solvation free energy correction was used. In contrast, the same protocol, using single solute conformations, performed poorly on the SAMPL5 dataset, obtaining R=0.73R=0.73 compared to the reference partition coefficients, likely due to the much larger solute sizes. Including solute conformational sampling through molecular dynamics coupled with 3D-RISM (MD/3D-RISM) improved agreement with the reference calculation to R=0.93R=0.93. Since our initial calculations only considered partition coefficients and not distribution coefficients, solute sampling provided little benefit comparing against experiment, where ionized and tautomer states are more important. Applying a simple pKa$\backslash$hbox \{p\}K\_\{$\backslash$text \{a\}\} correction improved agreement with experiment from R=0.54R=0.54 to R=0.66R=0.66, despite a small number of outliers. Better agreement is possible by accounting for tautomers and improving the ionization correction.},

  abstract = {In the context of SAMPL5, we submitted blind predictions of the cyclohexane/water distribution coefficient (D) for a series of 53 drug-like molecules. Our method is purely empirical and based on the additive contribution of each solute atom to the free energy of solvation in water and in cyclohexane. The contribution of each atom depends on the atom type and on the exposed surface area. Comparatively to similar methods in the literature, we used a very small set of atomic parameters: only 10 for solvation in water and 1 for solvation in cyclohexane. As a result, the method is protected from overfitting and the error in the blind predictions could be reasonably estimated. Moreover, this approach is fast: it takes only 0.5 s to predict the distribution coefficient for all 53 SAMPL5 compounds, allowing its application in virtual screening campaigns. The performance of our approach (submission 49) is modest but satisfactory in view of its efficiency: the root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.3 log D units for the 53 compounds, while the RMSE of the best performing method (using COSMO-RS) was 2.1 (submission 16). Our method is implemented as a Python script available at https://github.com/diogomart/SAMPL5-DC-surface-empirical.},

This computational blind challenge involved predicting protein\textendash{}ligand binding against the three allosteric sites of HIV integrase (IN), a viral enzyme for which two drugs (that target the active site) have been approved by the FDA. Positive control cross-docking experiments were utilized to select 13 receptor models out of an initial ensemble of 41 different crystal structures of HIV IN. These 13 models of the targets were selected using our new ``Rank Difference Ratio'' metric. The first stage of SAMPL4 involved using virtual screens to identify 62 active, allosteric IN inhibitors out of a set of 321 compounds. The second stage involved predicting the binding site(s) and crystallographic binding mode(s) for 57 of these inhibitors. Our team submitted four entries for the first stage that utilized: (1) AutoDock Vina (AD Vina) plus visual inspection; (2) a new common pharmacophore engine; (3) BEDAM replica exchange free energy simulations, and a Consensus approach that combined the predictions of all three strategies. Even with the SAMPL4's very challenging compound library that displayed a significantly lower amount of structural diversity than most libraries that are conventionally employed in prospective virtual screens, these approaches produced hit rates of 24, 25, 34, and 27 \%, respectively, on a set with 19 \% declared binders. Our only entry for the second stage challenge was based on the results of AD Vina plus visual inspection, and it ranked third place overall according to several different metrics provided by the SAMPL4 organizers. The successful results displayed by these approaches highlight the utility of the computational structure-based drug discovery tools and strategies that are being developed to advance the goals of the newly created, multi-institution, NIH-funded center called the ``HIV Interaction and Viral Evolution Center''.},

  abstract = {The SAMPL2 hydration free energy blind prediction challenge consisted of a data set of 41 molecules divided into three subsets: explanatory, obscure and investigatory, where experimental hydration free energies were given for the explanatory, withheld for the obscure, and not known for the investigatory molecules. We employed two solvation models for this challenge, a linear interaction energy (LIE) model based on explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations, and the first-shell hydration (FiSH) continuum model previously calibrated to mimic LIE data. On the 23 compounds from the obscure (blind) dataset, the prospectively submitted LIE and FiSH models provided predictions highly correlated with experimental hydration free energy data, with mean-unsigned-errors of 1.69 and 1.71 kcal/mol, respectively. We investigated several parameters that may affect the performance of these models, namely, the solute flexibility for the LIE explicit-solvent model, the solute partial charging method, and the incorporation of the difference in intramolecular energy between gas and solution phases for both models. We extended this analysis to the various chemical classes that can be formed within the SAMPL2 dataset. Our results strengthen previous findings on the excellent accuracy and transferability of the LIE explicit-solvent approach to predict transfer free energies across a wide spectrum of functional classes. Further, the current results on the SAMPL2 test dataset provide additional support for the FiSH continuum model as a fast yet accurate alternative to the LIE explicit-solvent model. Overall, both the LIE explicit-solvent model and the FiSH continuum solvation model show considerable improvement on the SAMPL2 data set over our previous continuum electrostatics-dispersion solvation model used in the SAMPL1 blind challenge.},

  abstract = {The correct representation of solute-water interactions is essential for the accurate simulation of most biological phenomena. Several highly accurate quantum methods are available to deal with solvation by using both implicit and explicit solvents. So far, however, most evaluations of those methods were based on a single conformation, which neglects solute entropy. Here, we present the first test of a novel approach to determine hydration free energies that uses molecular mechanics (MM) to sample phase space and quantum mechanics (QM) to evaluate the potential energies. Free energies are determined by using re-weighting with the Non-Boltzmann Bennett (NBB) method. In this context, the method is referred to as QM-NBB. Based on snapshots from MM sampling and accounting for their correct Boltzmann weight, it is possible to obtain hydration free energies that incorporate the effect of solute entropy. We evaluate the performance of several QM implicit solvent models, as well as explicit solvent QM/MM for the blind subset of the SAMPL4 hydration free energy challenge. While classical free energy simulations with molecular dynamics give root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, the hybrid approach yields an improved RMSD of 1.6 kcal/mol. By selecting an appropriate functional and basis set, the RMSD can be reduced to 1 kcal/mol for calculations based on a single conformation. Results for a selected set of challenging molecules imply that this RMSD can be further reduced by using NBB to reweight MM trajectories with the SMD implicit solvent model.},

Regular docking only performed slightly better than random selection, but the performance was significantly improved upon incorporation of additional filters based on pharmacophore queries and electrostatic similarities. The best performance was achieved when logical selection was added. For the pose prediction, we utilized a similar consensus approach that amalgamated the results of the Glide-XP docking with structural knowledge and rescoring. The pose prediction results revealed that docking displayed reasonable performance in predicting the binding poses. However, prediction performance can be improved utilizing scientific experience and rescoring approaches. In both the virtual screening and pose prediction challenges, the top performance was achieved by our approaches. Here we describe the methods and strategies used in our approaches and discuss the rationale of their performances.},

The predictions yield root mean square errors between 2.6 and 3.2 kcal/mol for seven host-guest systems. Those deviations are comparable to results for solvation free energies of small organic molecules. However, the standard deviations found in our simulations range from 0.4 to 2.4 kcal/mol, which indicates the need for better sampling. Three different approaches are compared. Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method and thermodynamic integration based on the trapezoidal rule with 12 $\lambda$-points exhibit a root mean square error of 2.6 kcal/mol, while thermodynamic integration with Simpson's rule and 11 $\lambda$-points leads to a root mean square error of 3.2 kcal/mol. In terms of absolute median errors, Bennett's Acceptance Ratio Method performs better than thermodynamic integration with the trapezoidal rule (1.7 vs. 2.9 kcal/mol). Simulations of the deprotonated forms of the guest molecules exhibit a poorer correspondence to experimental results with a root mean square error of 5.2 kcal/mol. In addition, a decrease of the buffer concentration by approximately 20 mM in the simulations raises the root mean square error to 3.8 kcal/mol.},

Our study reaffirmed that the real test for any virtual screening approach would be in a blind testing environment. The analyses presented in this paper also showed that virtual screening performance can be improved, if a set of known active compounds is available and parameters and methods that yield better enrichment are selected. Our study also highlighted that to achieve accurate orientation and conformation of ligands within a binding site, selecting an appropriate method to calculate partial charges is important. Another finding is that using multiple receptor ensembles in docking does not always yield better enrichment than individual receptors. On the basis of our results and retrospective analyses from SAMPL3 fragment screening challenge we anticipate that chances of success in a fragment screening process could be increased significantly with careful selection of receptor structures, protein flexibility, sufficient conformational sampling within binding pocket and accurate assignment of ligand and protein partial charges.},

We also determine an optimal restraint weight for Dielectric-RESP atomic charges fitting. Statistical analysis of the results could not distinguish the methods from one another. The smallest average unsigned error obtained is 1.9 $\pm$ 0.6 kcal/mol (95\% confidence level). A class of outliers led us to investigate the importance of the solute\textendash{}solvent instantaneous induction energy, a missing term in PB continuum models.

  abstract = {Extended solvent-contact model was applied to the blind prediction of the hydration free energies of 47 organic molecules included in the SAMPL4 data set. To obtain a suitable prediction tool, we constructed a hydration free energy function involving three kinds of atomic parameters. With respect to total 34 atom types introduced to describe all SAMPL4 molecules, 102 atomic parameters were defined and optimized with a standard genetic algorithm in such a way to minimize the difference between the experimental hydration free energies and those calculated with the hydration free energy function. In this parameterization, we used a training set comprising 77 organic molecules with varying sizes and shapes. The estimated hydration free energies for the SAMPL4 molecules compared reasonably well with the experimental results with the associated squared correlation coefficient and root mean square deviation of 0.89 and 1.46 kcal/mol, respectively. Based on the comparative analysis of experimental and computational hydration free energies of the SAMPL4 molecules, the methods for further improvement of the present hydration model are suggested.},

  abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations were used to blindly predict the hydration free energies of a range of small molecules as part of the SAMPL4 challenge. Compounds were parametrized on the basis of the OPLS-AA force field using three different protocols for deriving partial charges: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms and derivation of new parameters for a number of distinct chemical groups (N-alkyl imidazole, nitrate) that were not present in the published force field; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian09 at the HF/6-31G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. The absolute hydration free energy was computed by an established protocol including alchemical free energy perturbation with thermodynamic integration. The use of standard OPLS-AA charges (protocol 1) with a number of newly parametrized charges and the use of histidine derived parameters for imidazole yielded an overall root mean square deviation of the prediction from the experimental data of 1.75 kcal/mol. The precision of our results appears to be mainly limited by relatively poor reproducibility of the Lennard-Jones contribution towards the solvation free energy, for which we observed large variability that could be traced to a strong dependence on the initial system conditions.},

Several important discoveries about the molecular docking software were made during the challenge: (1) Solvation energies of ligands were five-fold worse than any other method used in SAMPL4, including methods that were similarly fast, (2) HIV Integrase is a challenging target, but automated docking on the correct allosteric site performed well in terms of virtual screening and pose prediction (compared to other methods) but affinity prediction, as expected, was very poor, (3) Molecular docking grid sizes can be very important, serious errors were discovered with default settings that have been adjusted for all future work. Overall, lessons from SAMPL4 suggest many changes to molecular docking tools, not just DOCK 3.7, that could improve the state of the art. Future difficulties and projects will be discussed.},

New features of the docking algorithm and scoring function are tested here prospectively for the first time. Wilma\textendash{}SIE provides good correlations with actual binding affinities over a wide range of binding affinities that includes strong binders as in the case of SAMPL4 host\textendash{}guest systems. Absolute binding affinities are also reproduced with appropriate training of the scoring function on available data sets or from comparative estimation of the change in target's vibrational entropy. Even when binding modes are known, SIE predictions lack correlation with experimental affinities within dynamic ranges below 2 kcal/mol as in the case of HIV-integrase ligands, but they correctly signaled the narrowness of the dynamic range. Using a common protein structure for all ligands can reduce the noise, while incorporating a more sophisticated solvation treatment improves absolute predictions. The HIV-integrase virtual screening data set consists of promiscuous weak binders with relatively high flexibility and thus it falls outside of the applicability domain of the Wilma\textendash{}SIE docking platform. Despite these difficulties, unbiased docking around three known binding sites of the enzyme resulted in over a third of ligands being docked within 2 {\AA} from their actual poses and over half of the ligands docked in the correct site, leading to better-than-random virtual screening results.},

  abstract = {Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases---such as cyclohexane and water--- the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water- saturated octanol phases, since it has which has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.},

  abstract = {The success of molecular fragment-based design depends critically on the ability to make predictions of binding poses and of affinity ranking for compounds assembled by linking fragments. The SAMPL3 Challenge provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art fragment-based design methodology with respect to these requirements. In this article, we present results derived from linking fragments to predict affinity and pose in the SAMPL3 Challenge. The goal is to demonstrate how incorporating different aspects of modeling protein\textendash{}ligand interactions impact the accuracy of the predictions, including protein dielectric models, charged versus neutral ligands, $\Delta\Delta$Gs solvation energies, and induced conformational stress. The core method is based on annealing of chemical potential in a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GC/MC) simulation. By imposing an initially very high chemical potential and then automatically running a sequence of simulations at successively decreasing chemical potentials, the GC/MC simulation efficiently discovers statistical distributions of bound fragment locations and orientations not found reliably without the annealing. This method accounts for configurational entropy, the role of bound water molecules, and results in a prediction of all the locations on the protein that have any affinity for the fragment. Disregarding any of these factors in affinity-rank prediction leads to significantly worse correlation with experimentally-determined free energies of binding. We relate three important conclusions from this challenge as applied to GC/MC: (1) modeling neutral ligands\textemdash{}regardless of the charged state in the active site\textemdash{}produced better affinity ranking than using charged ligands, although, in both cases, the poses were almost exactly overlaid; (2) simulating explicit water molecules in the GC/MC gave better affinity and pose predictions; and (3) applying a $\Delta\Delta$Gs solvation correction further improved the ranking of the neutral ligands. Using the GC/MC method under a variety of parameters in the blinded SAMPL3 Challenge provided important insights to the relevant parameters and boundaries in predicting binding affinities using simulated annealing of chemical potential calculations.},

Since the quantum chemical level underlying COSMOtherm, i.e. BP/TZVP DFT-calculations, is known to be of limited accuracy with respect to reaction energies, we tested MP2 reaction energy corrections in addition. As expected, the straight application of the latest version of COSMOtherm yielded a poor predictive accuracy of \textasciitilde{}4 kcal/mol (RMSE) for the eight compounds of the blind prediction data set, and the MP2-corrected predictions reduced the average error considerably to \textasciitilde{}1.2 kcal/mol. But a more detailed analysis shows that this improvement is not systematic and mostly a lucky coincidence on the small data set. The systematic results of COSMOtherm allow for an efficient empirical correction with an RMSE of 0.61 kcal/mol. This allows for systematic predictions for the most important case of generalized keto-enol tautomerism.},

In comparison with the experimental data, the blind test yields an average unsigned error of 2.38 kcal/mol and the root mean square deviation of 2.99 kcal/mol. Whereas these numbers are significantly larger than the best results from explicit-solvent MD simulations, we find that the theoretical performance is sensitive to both the molecular force fields and solute configurations and that a comparable level of accuracy can be achieved by a judicious selection of the solute configurations and the force-field parameters. Most importantly, CDFT reduces the computational cost of MD simulation by almost 3 orders of magnitude, making it very attractive for large-scale hydration free-energy calculations (e.g., screening the aqueous solubility of drug-like molecules).},

The AM1-BCC, restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and IpolQ-Mod approaches all perform reasonably well (R2 $>$ 0.8), while VCharge, though faster, gives less accurate results (R2 of 0.5). The AM1-BCC results are more accurate than those of RESP for tertiary amines and nitrates, but the overall difference in accuracy between these methods is not statistically significant. Interestingly, the IPolQ-Mod method is found to yield partial charges in very close agreement with RESP. This observation suggests that the success of RESP may be attributed to its fortuitously approximating the arguably more rigorous IPolQ approach.},

We use the free-energy perturbation method together with the AMOEBA polarizable force field and the Poltype parametrization protocol to predict the hydration free energies of 52 molecules as part of the SAMPL4 blind challenge. For comparison, similar calculations are performed using the non-polarizable General Amber force field. Against our expectations, the latter force field gives the better results compared to experiment. One possible explanation is the sensitivity of the AMOEBA results to the conformation used for parametrization.},

  abstract = {Several combinations of docking software and scoring functions were evaluated for their ability to predict the binding of a dataset of potential HIV integrase inhibitors. We found that different docking software were appropriate for each one of the three binding sites considered (LEDGF, Y3 and fragment sites), and the most suitable two docking protocols, involving Glide SP and Gold ChemScore, were selected using a training set of compounds identified from the structural data available. These protocols could successfully predict respectively 20.0 and 23.6 \% of the HIV integrase binders, all of them being present in the LEDGF site. When a different analysis of the results was carried out by removing all alternate isomers of binders from the set, our predictions were dramatically improved, with an overall ROC AUC of 0.73 and enrichment factor at 10 \% of 2.89 for the prediction obtained using Gold ChemScore. This study highlighted the ability of the selected docking protocols to correctly position in most cases the ortho-alkoxy-carboxylate core functional group of the ligands in the corresponding binding site, but also their difficulties to correctly rank the docking poses.},

One such method is the first-shell of hydration (FiSH) continuum model that was trained on hydration energetics from LIE calculations and molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Here we tested prospectively the FiSH model on the SAMPL-3 hydration data set that zooms in the effect of chlorination on solvation. We compare these FiSH predictions with those from retrospective LIE calculations. We find that neither FiSH nor LIE can reproduce well the absolute values and the trend of hydration free energies in the biphenyl and dioxin aromatic chlorination series. Some of the hypotheses behind this performance are discussed and tested. The LIE explicit-solvent model shows some improvement relative to the FiSH continuum model, and we correct a systematic deviation in the continuum van der Waals term of FiSH associated with aromatic Cl atom type.},

SAMPL2 represents the third annual blind prediction of transfer energies, and the first time tautomer ratios were included in the challenge. Over 60 sets of predictions were submitted, and each participant also attempted to estimate the error in their predictions, a task that proved difficult for most. The results of this blind assessment of the state of the field for transfer energy and tautomer ratio prediction both indicate where the field is performing well and point out flaws in current methods.},

The bulk-electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation is treated as follows: SM8 employs the generalized Born model with the Coulomb field approximation, SM8AD employs the generalized Born approximation with asymmetric descreening, and SMD solves the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation. The non-bulk-electrostatic contribution arising from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell is treated as a sum of terms that are products of geometry-dependent atomic surface tensions and solvent-accessible surface areas of the individual atoms of the solute. On average, three models tested in the present work perform similarly.

  abstract = {The SAMPL-1 hydration free energy blind prediction challenge data set includes 63 compounds that are more chemically diverse, polyfunctional, drug-like, and with examples of transfer free energies and molecular weights larger than ever before seen in previously tabulated data sets of neutral compounds. For the prospective SAMPL-1 study, we employed a continuum model including a boundary element solution of the Poisson equation to describe electrostatic solvation, a molecular surface area-based cost of cavity formation in water, and a continuum Lennard-Jones potential to account for dispersion-repulsion solute-solvent effects. For the latter contribution, continuum van der Waals atom-type coefficients were calibrated and validated on previously available hydration data sets. In the prospective study, this continuum hydration model yielded SAMPL-1 predictions highly correlated with experimental data, albeit with a slope of slightly above 0.5, suggesting a valid model but with a systematic error. Analysis of the major outliers, all overestimating the experimental hydration data, highlights a common structural theme as a possible cause of the prediction errors: densely polar and hydrogen-bond-capable structures, featuring primarily substituted (sulfon)amide groups, often in conjugated systems. By examining analog pairs within the SAMPL-1 data set, it was also noted that certain solvation trends are captured neither by chemical sense nor by our hydration model, which seem too additive. A retrospective analysis of model transferability between hydration data sets as a function of its parameters and complexity indicates that the electrostatic component of the model is fairly transferrable across data sets, but the nonelectrostatic terms are less so. For the chemical space covered in SAMPL-1, absolute prediction errors indicate that the simpler transferrable electrostatics-only model outperforms the more complex model including cavity and continuum dispersion terms. Possible directions to further improve this continuum hydration model are proposed.},

The correlation coefficient between computed and measured binding free energies is 70\% with high statistical significance. Multiple conformational stereoisomers and protonation states of the guests have been considered. Better agreement is obtained with high statistical confidence under acidic modeling conditions. It is shown that this level of quantitative agreement could have not been reached without taking into account reorganization energy and configurational entropy effects. Extensive conformational variability of the host, the guests and their complexes is observed in the simulations, affecting binding free energy estimates and structural predictions. A conformational reservoir technique is introduced as part of the parallel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics BEDAM protocol to fully capture conformational variability. It is shown that these advanced computational strategies lead to converged free energy estimates for these systems, offering the prospect of utilizing host-guest binding free energy data for force field validation and development.},

For the trypsin challenge, none of the methods were able to accurately predict the experimental results. For the MM/GB(PB)SA and LIE methods, the rankings were essentially random and the mean absolute deviations were much worse than a null hypothesis giving the same affinity to all ligand. Glide scoring gave a Kendall's $\tau$ index better than random, but the ranking is still only mediocre, $\tau$ = 0.2. However, the range of affinities is small and most of the pairs of ligands have an experimental affinity difference that is not statistically significant. Removing those pairs improves the ranking metric to 0.4\textendash{}1.0 for all methods except CLIE. Half of the trypsin ligands were non-binders according to the binding assay. The LIE methods could not separate the inactive ligands from the active ones better than a random guess, whereas MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA were slightly better than random (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, AUC = 0.65\textendash{}0.68), and Glide scoring was even better (AUC = 0.79). For the first host, MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA reproduce the experimental ranking fairly good, with $\tau$ = 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, whereas the Glide scoring was considerably worse, with a $\tau$ = 0.4, highlighting that the success of the methods is system-dependent.},

  abstract = {Prediction of the free energy of solvation of a small molecule, or its transfer energy, is a necessary step along the path towards calculating the interactions between molecules that occur in an aqueous environment. A set of these transfer energies were gathered from the literature for series of chlorinated molecules with varying numbers of chlorines based on ethane, biphenyl, and dibenzo-p-dioxin. This focused set of molecules were then provided as a blinded challenge to assess the ability of current computational solvation methods to accurately model the interactions between water and increasingly chlorinated compounds. This was presented as part of the SAMPL3 challenge, which represented the fourth iterative blind prediction challenge involving transfer energies. The results of this exercise demonstrate that the field in general has difficulty predicting the transfer energies of more highly chlorinated compounds, and that methods seem to be erring in the same direction.},

  abstract = {For the fifth time I have provided a set of solvation energies (1 M gas to 1 M aqueous) for a SAMPL challenge. In this set there are 23 blind compounds and 30 supplementary compounds of related structure to one of the blind sets, but for which the solvation energy is readily available. The best current values of each compound are presented along with complete documentation of the experimental origins of the solvation energies. The calculations needed to go from reported data to solvation energies are presented, with particular attention to aspects which are new to this set. For some compounds the vapor pressures (VP) were reported for the liquid compound, which is solid at room temperature. To correct from VPsubcooled liquid to VPsublimation requires $\Delta$Sfusion, which is only known for mannitol. Estimated values were used for the others, all but one of which were benzene derivatives and expected to have very similar values. The final compound for which $\Delta$Sfusion was estimated was menthol, which melts at 42 $^\circ$C so that modest errors in $\Delta$Sfusion will have little effect. It was also necessary to look into the effects of including estimated values of $\Delta$Cp on this correction. The approximate sizes of the effects of inclusion of $\Delta$Cp in the correction from VPsubcooledliquid to VPsublimation were estimated and it was noted that inclusion of $\Delta$Cp invariably makes $\Delta$GS more positive. To extend the set of compounds for which the solvation energy could be calculated we explored the use of boiling point (b.p.) data from Reaxys/Beilstein as a substitute for studies of the VP as a function of temperature. B.p. data are not always reliable so it was necessary to develop a criterion for rejecting outliers. For two compounds (chlorinated guaiacols) it became clear that inclusion represented overreach; for each there were only two independent pressure, temperature points, which is too little for a trustworthy extrapolation. For a number of compounds the extrapolation from lowest temperature at which the VP was reported to 25 $^\circ$C was long (sometimes over 100$^\circ$) so that it was necessary to consider whether $\Delta$Cp might have significant effects. The problem is that there are no experimental values and possible intramolecular hydrogen bonds make estimation uncertain in some cases. The approximate sizes of the effects of $\Delta$Cp were estimated, and it was noted that inclusion of $\Delta$Cp in the extrapolation of VP down to room temperature invariably makes $\Delta$Gs more negative.},

Computations of hydration free energies was performed using both HF/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-31G(d) versions of the IEF-MST model. For tautomeric preferences, the IEF-MST data was combined with the gas phase free energy differences predicted at different levels of theory ranging from MP2/6-31+G(d) to MP2/CBS+[CCSD-MP2/6-31+G(d)] levels. Comparison with the experimental data provided for hydration free energies yields a root-mean square deviation (rmsd) close to 2.3 kcal/mol, which is quite remarkable, especially considering the reduced set of training compounds used in the parametrization of the IEF-MST method. With regard to tautomerism, the lowest error in the prediction of the relative stabilities between tautomers in solution is obtained by combining MP2/CBS+[CCSD-MP2/6-31+G(d)] results with IEF-MST hydration free energies, yielding a rmsd of ca. 3.4 kcal/mol. The results illustrate the delicate balance that must be kept between the intrinsic relative stabilities in the gas phase and the differential hydration preferences in order to obtain an accurate description of the prototropic tautomerism in bioorganic compounds.},

First, SEA uses an approximate analytical surface around the solute on which a water potential is computed. We have improved and simplified the mathematical model of that surface. Second, some of the solutes in SAMPL5 were large enough to need a way to treat solvating waters interacting with `buried atoms', i.e. interior atoms of the solute. We improved SEA with a buried-atom correction. We also compare SEA to Thermodynamic Integration molecular dynamics simulations, so that we can sort out force field errors.},

We also describe the torsion-restrain method we used to improve sampling of molecular conformational space and thus the overall accuracy of prediction.

To maintain simplicity and use only a single method, we approximate the distribution coefficient with the partition coefficient of the neutral species.

The distribution coefficient was calculated from the solvation free energies of the compound in water and cyclohexane. Absolute solvation free energies were computed by an established protocol using windowed alchemical free energy perturbation with thermodynamic integration. This protocol resulted in an overall root mean square error in logDcwlog⁡Dcw$\backslash$log D\_\{cw\} of almost 4 log units and an overall signed error of -3 compared to experimental data. There was no substantial overall difference in accuracy between simulating in NVT and NPT ensembles. The signed error suggests a systematic error but the experimental DcwDcwD\_\{cw\} data on their own are insufficient to uncover the source of this error. Preliminary work suggests that the major source of error lies in the hydration free energy calculations.},

  abstract = {We have tried to calculate the free energy for the binding of six small ligands to two variants of the octa-acid deep cavitand host in the SAMPL5 blind challenge. We employed structures minimised with dispersion-corrected density-functional theory with small basis sets and energies were calculated using large basis sets. Solvation energies were calculated with continuum methods and thermostatistical corrections were obtained from frequencies calculated at the HF-3c level. Care was taken to minimise the effects of the flexibility of the host by keeping the complexes as symmetric and similar as possible. In some calculations, the large net charge of the host was reduced by removing the propionate and benzoate groups. In addition, the effect of a restricted molecular dynamics sampling of structures was tested. Finally, we tried to improve the energies by using the DLPNO\textendash{}CCSD(T) approach. Unfortunately, results of quite poor quality were obtained, with no correlation to the experimental data, systematically too positive affinities (by \textasciitilde{}50 kJ/mol) and a mean absolute error (after removal of the systematic error) of 11\textendash{}16 kJ/mol. DLPNO\textendash{}CCSD(T) did not improve the results, so the accuracy is not limited by the energy function. Instead, four likely sources of errors were identified: first, the minimised structures were often incorrect, owing to the omission of explicit solvent. They could be partly improved by performing the minimisations in a continuum solvent with four water molecules around the charged groups of the ligands. Second, some ligands could bind in several different conformations, requiring sampling of reasonable structures. Third, there is an indication the continuum-solvation model has problems to accurately describe the binding of both the negatively and positively charged guest molecules. Fourth, different methods to calculate the thermostatistical corrections gave results that differed by up to 30 kJ/mol and there is an indication that HF-3c overestimates the entropy term. In conclusion, it is a challenge to calculate binding affinities for this octa-acid system with quantum\textendash{}mechanical methods.},

  abstract = {The performance of the extended solvent-contact model has been addressed in the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge for distribution coefficient (LogD) of drug-like molecules with respect to the cyclohexane/water partitioning system. All the atomic parameters defined for 41 atom types in the solvation free energy function were optimized by operating a standard genetic algorithm with respect to water and cyclohexane solvents. In the parameterizations for cyclohexane, the experimental solvation free energy ($\Delta$Gsol) data of 15 molecules for 1-octanol were combined with those of 77 molecules for cyclohexane to construct a training set because $\Delta$Gsol values of the former were unavailable for cyclohexane in publicly accessible databases. Using this hybrid training set, we established the LogD prediction model with the correlation coefficient (R), average error (AE), and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.55, 1.53, and 3.03, respectively, for the comparison of experimental and computational results for 53 SAMPL5 molecules. The modest accuracy in LogD prediction could be attributed to the incomplete optimization of atomic solvation parameters for cyclohexane. With respect to 31 SAMPL5 molecules containing the atom types for which experimental reference data for $\Delta$Gsol were available for both water and cyclohexane, the accuracy in LogD prediction increased remarkably with the R, AE, and RMSE values of 0.82, 0.89, and 1.60, respectively. This significant enhancement in performance stemmed from the better optimization of atomic solvation parameters by limiting the element of training set to the molecules with experimental $\Delta$Gsol data for cyclohexane. Due to the simplicity in model building and to low computational cost for parameterizations, the extended solvent-contact model is anticipated to serve as a valuable computational tool for LogD prediction upon the enrichment of experimental $\Delta$Gsol data for organic solvents.},

This makes it difficult to assess whether computational methods are truly predictive of this important quantity or merely good at explaining what has been seen. To explore this, a prospective test was performed of two different methods for estimating solvation free energies: an implicit solvent approach based on the Poisson\textendash{}Boltzmann equation and an explicit solvent approach using alchemical free energy calculations. For a set of 17 small molecules, root mean square errors from experiment were between 1.3 and 2.6 kcal/mol, with the explicit solvent free energy approach yielding somewhat greater accuracy but at greater computational expense.

The calculations were performed using a fully automated protocol that incorporated a dynamic analysis of the convergence and integration error in the selection of intermediate points. The system has been designed and implemented such that hydration free enthalpies can be obtained without manual intervention following the submission of a molecule to the ATB. The overall average unsigned error (AUE) using ATB 2.0 topologies for the complete set of 214 molecules was 6.7 kJ/mol and for molecules within the SAMPL4 7.5 kJ/mol. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 9.5 and 10.0 kJ/mol respectively. However, for molecules containing functional groups that form part of the main GROMOS force field the AUE was 3.4 kJ/mol and the RMSE was 4.0 kJ/mol. This suggests it will be possible to further refine the parameters provided by the ATB based on hydration free enthalpies.},

Since experimental structures of the complexes were not provided, this was an exercise in virtual docking as well. We used our exhaustive docking program, Wilma, to provide high-quality poses that were rescored using SIE to provide binding affinity predictions. We also tested the combination of SIE with our latest solvation model, first shell of hydration (FiSH), which captures some of the discrete properties of water within a continuum model. We achieved good enrichment in virtual screening of fragments against trypsin, with an area under the curve of about 0.7 for the receiver operating characteristic curve. Moreover, the early enrichment performance was quite good with 50\% of true actives recovered with a 15\% false positive rate in a prospective calculation and with a 3\% false positive rate in a retrospective application of SIE with FiSH. Binding affinity predictions for both trypsin and host\textendash{}guest complexes were generally within 2 kcal/mol of the experimental values. However, the rank ordering of affinities differing by 2 kcal/mol or less was not well predicted. On the other hand, it was encouraging that the incorporation of a more sophisticated solvation model into SIE resulted in better discrimination of true binders from binders. This suggests that the inclusion of proper Physics in our models is a fruitful strategy for improving the reliability of our binding affinity predictions.},

  abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations were used to blindly predict the hydration free energies of a range of chloro-organic compounds as part of the SAMPL3 challenge. All compounds were parameterized within the framework of the OPLS-AA force field, using an established protocol to compute the absolute hydration free energy via a windowed free energy perturbation approach and thermodynamic integration. Three different approaches to deriving partial charge parameters were pursued: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian03 at the HF/6-31G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. Protocol 3 generated the most accurate predictions with a root mean square (RMS) error of 1.2kcalmol-11.2kcalmol-11.2$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\}$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} for the entire data set. It was found that the deficiency of the standard OPLS-AA parameters, protocol 1 (RMS error 2.4kcalmol-12.4kcalmol-12.4$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\}$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} overall), was mostly due to compounds with more than three chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring. For this latter subset, the RMS errors were 1.4kcalmol-11.4kcalmol-11.4$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\}$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} (protocol 3) and 4.3kcalmol-14.3kcalmol-14.3$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\} $\backslash$, $\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} (protocol 1), respectively. We propose new OPLS-AA atom types for aromatic carbon and chlorine atoms in rings with $\geq$4 Cl-substituents that perform better than the best QM-based approach, resulting in an RMS error of 1.2kcalmol-11.2kcalmol-11.2$\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{kcal\} $\backslash$,$\backslash$hbox\{mol\}\^\{-1\} for these difficult compounds.},

  abstract = {Two families of binding affinity estimation methodologies are described which were utilized in the SAMPL3 trypsin/fragment binding affinity challenge. The first is a free energy decomposition scheme based on a thermodynamic cycle, which included separate contributions from enthalpy and entropy of binding as well as a solvent contribution. Enthalpic contributions were estimated with PM6-DH2 semiempirical quantum mechanical interaction energies, which were modified with a statistical error correction procedure. Entropic contributions were estimated with the rigid-rotor harmonic approximation, and solvent contributions to the free energy were estimated with several different methods. The second general methodology is the empirical score LISA, which contains several physics-based terms trained with the large PDBBind database of protein/ligand complexes. Here we also introduce LISA+, an updated version of LISA which, prior to scoring, classifies systems into one of four classes based on a ligand's hydrophobicity and molecular weight. Each version of the two methodologies (a total of 11 methods) was trained against a compiled set of known trypsin binders available in the Protein Data Bank to yield scaling parameters for linear regression models. Both raw and scaled scores were submitted to SAMPL3. Variants of LISA showed relatively low absolute errors but also low correlation with experiment, while the free energy decomposition methods had modest success when scaling factors were included. Nonetheless, re-scaled LISA yielded the best predictions in the challenge in terms of RMS error, and six of these models placed in the top ten best predictions by RMS error. This work highlights some of the difficulties of predicting binding affinities of small molecular fragments to protein receptors as well as the benefit of using training data.},

The electronic structure of the solute is determined self-consistently with the structure of the solvent that is described by 3D RISM integral equation theory. The continuous solvent-site distribution is mapped onto a set of discrete background charges (``embedded cluster'') that represent an additional contribution to the molecular Hamiltonian. The EC-RISM analysis of the SAMPL2 challenge set of tautomers proceeds in three stages. Firstly, the group of compounds for which quantitative experimental free energy data was provided was taken to determine appropriate levels of quantum-chemical theory for geometry optimization and free energy prediction. Secondly, the resulting workflow was applied to the full set, allowing for chemical interpretations of the results. Thirdly, disclosure of experimental data for parts of the compounds facilitated a detailed analysis of methodical issues and suggestions for future improvements of the model. Without specifically adjusting parameters, the EC-RISM model yields the smallest value of the root mean square error for the first set (0.6 kcal mol-1) as well as for the full set of quantitative reaction data (2.0 kcal mol-1) among the SAMPL2 participants.},

The energy of the individual encapsulated water molecules decreases with increasing cavity size, because larger cavities allow for the formation of more stable H-bonded networks. Conversely, the total energy of internal water increases with the cavity size because the absolute number of water molecules increases. For CB7, which has emerged as an ultrahigh affinity binder, these counteracting effects result in a maximum energy gain through a complete removal of water molecules from the cavity. A new design criterion for aqueous synthetic receptors has therefore emerged, which is the optimization of the size of cavities and binding pockets with respect to the energy and number of residing water molecules.},

  abstract = {ConspectusThis Account focuses on stimuli responsive systems that function in aqueous solution using examples drawn from the work of the Isaacs group using cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) molecular containers as key recognition elements. Our entry into the area of stimuli responsive systems began with the preparation of glycoluril derived molecular clips that efficiently distinguish between self and nonself by H-bonds and $\pi$\textendash$\pi$ interactions even within complex mixtures and therefore undergo self-sorting. We concluded that the selectivity of a wide variety of H-bonded supramolecular assemblies was higher than previously appreciated and that self-sorting is not exceptional behavior. This lead us to examine self-sorting within the context of CB[n] host\textendash{}guest chemistry in water.We discovered that CB[n] homologues (CB[7] and CB[8]) display remarkably high binding affinity (Ka up to 1017 M\textendash{}1) and selectivity ($\Delta\Delta$G) toward their guests, which renders CB[n]s prime components for the construction of stimuli responsive host\textendash{}guest systems. The CB[7]$\cdot$adamantaneammonium ion complex, which is particularly privileged (Ka = 4.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M\textendash{}1), was introduced by us as a stimulus to trigger constitutional changes in multicomponent self-sorting systems. For example, we describe how the free energy associated with the formation of host\textendash{}guest complexes of CB[n]-type receptors can drive conformational changes of included guests like triazene\textendash{}arylene foldamers and cationic calix[4]arenes, as well as induced conformational changes (e.g., ammonium guest size dependent homotropic allostery, metal ion triggered folding, and heterochiral dimerization) of the hosts themselves.Many guests display large pKa shifts within their CB[n]\textendash{}guest complexes, which we used to promote pH controlled guest swapping and thermal trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene derivatives. We also used the high affinity and selectivity of CB[7] toward its guests to outcompete an enzyme (bovine carbonic anhydrase) for a two-faced inhibitor, which allowed stimuli responsive regulation of enzymatic activity. These results prompted us to examine the use of CB[n]-type receptors in both in vitro and in vivo biological systems. We demonstrated that adamantaneammonium ion can be used to intracellularly sequester CB[7] from gold nanoparticles passivated with hexanediammonium ion$\cdot$CB[7] complexes and thereby trigger cytotoxicity. CB[7] derivatives bearing a biotin targeting group enhance the cytotoxicity of encapsulated oxaliplatin toward L1210FR cells. Finally, acyclic CB[n]-type receptors function as solubilizing excipients for insoluble drugs for drug delivery purposes and as a broad spectrum reversal agent for the neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium, vecuronium, and cis-atracurium in rats. The work highlights the great potential for integration of CB[n]-type receptors with biological systems.},

  abstract = {We report that the p-xylylenediammonium ion (11) acts as a template in the cucurbit[n]uril forming reaction that biases the reaction toward the production of methylene bridged glycoluril hexamer (6C) and bis-nor-seco-CB[10]. Hexamer 6C is readily available on the gram scale by a one step synthetic procedure that avoids chromatography. Hexamer 6C undergoes macrocylization with (substituted) phthalaldehydes 12, 14, 15, and 18\textemdash{}in 9 M H2SO4 or concd HCl at room temperature to deliver monofunctionalized CB[6] derivatives 13, 16, 17, and 19\textemdash{}that are poised for further functionalization reactions. The kinetics of the macrocyclization reaction between hexamer and formaldehyde or phthalaldehyde depends on the presence and identity of ammonium ions as templates. p-Xylylenediammonium ion (11) which barely fits inside CB[6] sized cavities acts as a negative template which slows down transformation of 6C and paraformaldehyde into CB[6]. In contrast, 11 and hexanediammonium ion (20) act as a positive template that promotes the macrocyclization reaction between 6C and 12 to deliver ($\pm$)-21 as a key intermediate along the mechanistic pathway to CB[6] derivatives. Naphthalene-CB[6] derivative 19 which contains both fluorophore and ureidyl C═O metal-ion (e.g., Eu3+) binding sites forms the basis for a fluorescence turn-on assay for suitable ammonium ions (e.g., hexanediammonium ion and histamine).},

  abstract = {We present the design, synthesis via methylene bridged glycoluril tetramer building blocks, and charaterization of acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners that function as hosts for a wide variety of ammonium ions in water. The X-ray crystallographic characterization of the free host and its complexes with p-xylylenediamine and spermine establish the flexibility of the methylene bridged backbone of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners that allow them to adapt to the structural features of the guest. We find that the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners\rule{1em}{1pt}with their four contiguous methylene bridged glycoluril units and two aromatic o-xylylene walls bearing CO2H substituents\rule{1em}{1pt}bind to ammonium ions in buffered water with values of Ka ranging from $\sim$105 M-1 to greater than 109 M-1. Similar to the cucurbit[n]uril family of hosts, we find that increasing the concentration of metal cations in the buffer reduces the affinity of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congener toward guests by competitive binding at the ureidyl C═O portals. Although the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners retain the ability to bind to ammonium ions with high affinity, they do so with lower selectivity than cucurbit[n]urils presumably do to the structural flexibility of the hosts. A methylene bridged glycoluril tetramer model compound that lacks the substituted o-xylylene walls is a much lower affinity host, which establishes the importance of these rings on the overall recognition behavior of the acyclic cucurbit[n]uril congeners. Overall, the results in this paper establish that acyclic cucurbit[n]uril receptors that contain four or more contiguous methylene bridged glycoluril units retain many of the excellent recognition properties of the cucurbit[n]uril family.},

  abstract = {The factors affecting host-guest complexation between the molecular container compound cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and various guests in aqueous solution are studied, and a detailed complexation mechanism in the presence of cations is derived. The formation of the supramolecular complex is studied in detail for cyclohexylmethylammonium ion as guest. The kinetics and thermodynamics of complexation is monitored by NMR as a function of temperature, salt concentration, and cation size. The binding constants and the ingression rate constants decrease with increasing salt concentration and cation-binding constant, in agreement with a competitive binding of the ammonium site of the guest and the metal cation with the ureido carbonyl portals of CB6. Studies as a function of guest size indicate that the effective container volume of the CB6 cavity is approximately 105 {\AA}3. It is suggested that larger guests are excluded for two reasons:\, a high activation barrier for ingression imposed by the tight CB6 portals and a destabilization of the complex due to steric repulsion inside. For example, in the case of the nearly spherical azoalkane homologues 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (DBH, volume ca. 96 {\AA}3) and 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene (DBO, volume ca. 110 {\AA}3), the former forms the CB6 complex promptly with a sizable binding constant (1300 M-1), while the latter does not form a complex even after several months at optimized complexation conditions. Molecular mechanics calculations are performed for several CB6/guest complexes. A qualitative agreement is found between experimental and calculated activation energies for ingression as a function of both guest size and state of protonation. The potential role of constrictive binding by CB6 is discussed.},

  abstract = {Traditional descriptions of the hydrophobic effect on the basis of entropic arguments or the calculation of solvent-occupied surfaces must be questioned in view of new results obtained with supramolecular complexes. In these studies, it was possible to separate hydrophobic from dispersive interactions, which are strongest in aqueous systems. Even very hydrophobic alkanes associate significantly only in cavities containing water molecules with an insufficient number of possible hydrogen bonds. The replacement of high-energy water in cavities by guest molecules is the essential enthalpic driving force for complexation, as borne out by data for complexes of cyclodextrins, cyclophanes, and cucurbiturils, for which complexation enthalpies of up to -100\hspace{0.25em}kJ\,mol-1 were reached for encapsulated alkyl residues. Water-box simulations were used to characterize the different contributions from high-energy water and enabled the calculation of the association free enthalpies for selected cucurbituril complexes to within a 10\,\% deviation from experimental values. Cavities in artificial receptors are more apt to show the enthalpic effect of high-energy water than those in proteins or nucleic acids, because they bear fewer or no functional groups in the inner cavity to stabilize interior water molecules.},

  abstract = {Cucurbit[n]urils (CBn) bind guest molecules through a combination of electrostatic interactions with the carbonyl rims and hydrophobic interactions with the inner cavity. Investigations with solvatochromic probes in CB7 reveal that the polarity of the cavity resembles that of alcohols (e.g., n-octanol), while its polarizability (P=0.12) and apparent refractive index (nD=1.10$\pm$0.12) are extremely low, close to the gas phase. The calculated molecular quadrupole moments of CBs are extremely large ($\Theta$zz=-120 to -340 Buckingham). A survey of reported binding constants of neutral guests and hydrophobic residues that form 1\,:\,1 inclusion complexes with CB6, reveals a preferential inclusion of C3\textendash{}C5 residues in its cavity. The largest guests which show non-negligible binding contain 7 heavy atoms (excluding hydrogen). For CB7, the strongest binding is observed for guests with adamantyl (10 heavy atoms) and ferrocenyl groups (11 heavy atoms), while the largest guests known to be complexed are carborane and the adduct of two pyridine derivatives (12 heavy atoms). The evaluation of different volumes shows that the most meaningful cavity, namely that responsible for binding of hydrophobic residues, is confined by the planes through the oxygen carbonyls. The volume of this inner cavity follows the formula V/{\AA}3=68+62(n-5)+12.5(n-5)2, affording representative cavity volumes of 68\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB5, 142\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB6, 242\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB7, and 367\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB8. The volume of the 2 bond dipole regions is comparably smaller, amounting, for example, to 2\texttimes{}35\hspace{0.25em}{\AA}3 for CB6. The analysis of packing coefficients for representative sets of known guests with clearly defined hydrophobic binding motifs reveals average values of 47\,\% for CB5, 58\,\% for CB6, 52\,\% for CB7, and 53\,\% for CB8, which are well in line with the preferred packing (``55\,\% solution'', see S. Mecozzi, J. Rebek, Chem. Eur. J.1998, 4, 1016\textendash{}1022) in related supramolecular host\textendash{}guest assemblies. The driving force for binding of hydrophobic guests and residues by CBs is interpreted in terms of the unimportance of dispersion interactions (owing to the low polarizability of their cavity) and the dominance of classical and nonclassical hydrophobic effects related to the removal of very-high-energy water molecules (2 for CB5, 4 for CB6, 8 for CB7, and 12 for CB8) from the cavity.},

Cucurbiturils, in particular, stand out in that they do not only provide a hydrophobic cavity to encapsulate the drug in the form of a host\textendash{}guest complex, but in that they possess cation-receptor properties, which favor the encapsulation of protonated drugs over their unprotonated forms, resulting in pronounced pKa shifts up to 5 units. These pKa shifts can be rationally exploited to activate prodrug molecules, to stabilize the active form of drug molecules, to enhance their solubility, and to increase their degree of ionization, factors which can jointly serve to enhance the bioavailability of drugs, particularly weakly basic ones. Additionally, macrocycles can serve to increase the chemical stability of drugs by protecting them against reactions with nucleophiles (e.g., thiols) and electrophiles, by increasing their photostability, and by causing a higher thermal stability in the solid state. Detailed examples of the different effects of macrocyclic encapsulation of drugs and the associated pKa shifts are provided and discussed. Other important considerations, namely a potential lowering of the bioactivity of drugs by macrocyclic complexation, interferences of the macrocycles with biocatalytic processes, the toxicity of the macrocyclic host molecules, and problems and opportunities related to a targeted release and the rate of release of the drug from the host\textendash{}guest complexes are critically evaluated.},

The cavity of 1 is shaped by aromatic surfaces of negative electrostatic potential and therefore displays high affinity and selectivity for planar and cationic aromatic guests that distinguishes it from CB[n] receptors that prefer aliphatic over aromatic guests. Electrostatic effects play a dominant role in the recognition process whereby ion\textendash{}dipole interactions may occur between ammonium ions and the C=O groups of 1, between the SO3- groups of 1 and pendant cationic groups on the guest, and within the cavity of 1 by cation\textendash$\pi$ interactions.

The critical importance of cation\textendash$\pi$ interactions was ascertained by a comparison of analogous neutral and cationic guests (e.g. methylene violet vs. methylene blue; quinoline vs. N-methylquinolinium; acridine vs. N-methylacridinium; neutral red vs. neutral red H+) the affinities of which differ by up to 380-fold.

The results further establish that acyclic CB[n]-type receptor 1 is preorganised into the C-shape required for binding and that its aromatic o-xylylene walls endow it with a potency towards aromatic ammonium ions. The K a values reported in this paper constitute a blind data-set used in the SAMPL3 challenge aimed at testing computational methods relevant to protein$\surd$ligand systems. The work thus highlights the great potential of CB[n] receptors as model systems to promote synergy between the supramolecular and computational chemistry communities.},

  abstract = {We describe binding free energy calculations in the D3R Grand Challenge 2015 for blind prediction of the binding affinities of 180 ligands to Hsp90. The present D3R challenge was built around experimental datasets involving Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90, an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone which is an important anticancer drug target. The Hsp90 ATP binding site is known to be a challenging target for accurate calculations of ligand binding affinities because of the ligand-dependent conformational changes in the binding site, the presence of ordered waters and the broad chemical diversity of ligands that can bind at this site. Our primary focus here is to distinguish binders from nonbinders. Large scale absolute binding free energy calculations that cover over 3000 protein\textendash{}ligand complexes were performed using the BEDAM method starting from docked structures generated by Glide docking. Although the ligand dataset in this study resembles an intermediate to late stage lead optimization project while the BEDAM method is mainly developed for early stage virtual screening of hit molecules, the BEDAM binding free energy scoring has resulted in a moderate enrichment of ligand screening against this challenging drug target. Results show that, using a statistical mechanics based free energy method like BEDAM starting from docked poses offers better enrichment than classical docking scoring functions and rescoring methods like Prime MM-GBSA for the Hsp90 data set in this blind challenge. Importantly, among the three methods tested here, only the mean value of the BEDAM binding free energy scores is able to separate the large group of binders from the small group of nonbinders with a gap of 2.4 kcal/mol. None of the three methods that we have tested provided accurate ranking of the affinities of the 147 active compounds. We discuss the possible sources of errors in the binding free energy calculations. The study suggests that BEDAM can be used strategically to discriminate binders from nonbinders in virtual screening and to more accurately predict the ligand binding modes prior to the more computationally expensive FEP calculations of binding affinity.},

  abstract = {We have estimated the binding affinity of three sets of ligands of the heat-shock protein 90 in the D3R grand challenge blind test competition. We have employed four different methods, based on five different crystal structures: first, we docked the ligands to the proteins with induced-fit docking with the Glide software and calculated binding affinities with three energy functions. Second, the docked structures were minimised in a continuum solvent and binding affinities were calculated with the MM/GBSA method (molecular mechanics combined with generalised Born and solvent-accessible surface area solvation). Third, the docked structures were re-optimised by combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. Then, interaction energies were calculated with quantum mechanical calculations employing 970\textendash{}1160 atoms in a continuum solvent, combined with energy corrections for dispersion, zero-point energy and entropy, ligand distortion, ligand solvation, and an increase of the basis set to quadruple-zeta quality. Fourth, relative binding affinities were estimated by free-energy simulations, using the multi-state Bennett acceptance-ratio approach. Unfortunately, the results were varying and rather poor, with only one calculation giving a correlation to the experimental affinities larger than 0.7, and with no consistent difference in the quality of the predictions from the various methods. For one set of ligands, the results could be strongly improved (after experimental data were revealed) if it was recognised that one of the ligands displaced one or two water molecules. For the other two sets, the problem is probably that the ligands bind in different modes than in the crystal structures employed or that the conformation of the ligand-binding site or the whole protein changes.},

  abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein\textendash{}ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host\textendash{}guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host\textendash{}guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of SAMPL prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present SAMPL5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the SAMPL challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host\textendash{}guest component of SAMPL5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior SAMPL rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

  abstract = {In the recent SAMPL5 challenge, participants submitted predictions for cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 small molecules. Distribution coefficients (log D) replace the hydration free energies that were a central part of the past five SAMPL challenges. A wide variety of computational methods were represented by the 76 submissions from 18 participating groups. Here, we analyze submissions by a variety of error metrics and provide details for a number of reference calculations we performed. As in the SAMPL4 challenge, we assessed the ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical uncertainty, but their model uncertainty\textemdash{}how well they can predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around 1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge provided great insight into the importance of modeling a variety of physical effects. We believe these types of measurements will be a promising source of data for future blind challenges, especially in view of the relatively straightforward nature of the experiments and the level of insight provided.},

These calculations begin with a detailed description of a system, including its chemical composition and the interactions between its components. Simulations of the system are then used to compute thermodynamic information, such as binding affinities. Because of their promise for guiding molecular design, these calculations have recently begun to see widespread applications in early stage drug discovery. However, many challenges remain to make them a robust and reliable tool. Here, we briefly explain how the calculations work, highlight key challenges, and argue for the development of accepted benchmark test systems that will help the research community generate and evaluate progress.},

In this work, adaptive biasing force molecular dynamics simulations are used to determine absolute free energies of hydration, solvation, and 1-octanol\textendash{}water partition coefficients for n-alkanes from methane to octane. Two approaches are evaluated; the direct transfer of the solute from 1-octanol to water phase, and separate transfers of the solute from the water or 1-octanol phase to vacuum, with both methods yielding statistically indistinguishable results. Calculations performed with the TIP4P and SPC/E water models and the TraPPE united-atom force field for n-alkanes show that the choice of water model has a negligible effect on predicted free energies of transfer and partition coefficients for n-alkanes. A comparison of calculations using wet and dry octanol phases shows that the predictions for log Kow using wet octanol are 0.2\textendash{}0.4 log units lower than for dry octanol, although this is within the statistical uncertainty of the calculation.},

Many kinase inhibitors\textemdash{}including the cancer drug imatinib\textemdash{}selectively target a specific DFG conformation, but the function and mechanism of the flip remain unclear. Using long molecular dynamics simulations of the Abl kinase, we visualized the DFG flip in atomic-level detail and formulated an energetic model predicting that protonation of the DFG aspartate controls the flip. Consistent with our model's predictions, we demonstrated experimentally that the kinetics of imatinib binding to Abl kinase have a pH dependence that disappears when the DFG aspartate is mutated. Our model suggests a possible explanation for the high degree of conservation of the DFG motif: that the flip, modulated by electrostatic changes inherent to the catalytic cycle, allows the kinase to access flexible conformations facilitating nucleotide binding and release.},

  abstract = {Human serum albumin possesses multiple binding sites and transports a wide range of ligands that include the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of this protein in accommodating small ligands. In this work, we provide a set of predictions covering the geometry, affinity of binding and protonation state for the pharmaceutically most active form (S-isomer) of ibuprofen to albumin, by using absolute binding free energy calculations in combination with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The most favorable binding modes correctly reproduce several experimentally identified binding locations, which include the two Sudlow's drug sites (DS2 and DS1) and the fatty acid binding sites 6 and 2 (FA6 and FA2). Previously unknown details of the binding conformations were revealed for some of them, and formerly undetected binding modes were found in other protein sites. The calculated binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form. These findings provide a detailed description of the binding of ibuprofen, help to explain a wide range of results reported in the literature in the last decades, and demonstrate the possibility of using simulation methods to predict ligand binding to albumin.},

Using this strategy, we determine simple and transferable hydroxyl modulation rules that, when applied to an existing molecular parameter set, result in a newly dielectric corrected (DC) parameter set. We applied these rules to the general Amber force field (GAFF) to form an initial set of GAFF-DC parameters, and we found this to lead to significant improvement in the calculated dielectric constant and hydration free energy values for a wide variety of small molecule alcohol models. Tests of the GAFF-DC parameters in the SAMPL4 blind prediction event for hydration show these changes improve agreement with experiment. Surprisingly, these simple modifications also outperform detailed quantum mechanical electric field calculations using a self-consistent reaction field environment coupling term. This work provides a potential benchmark for future developments in methods for representing condensed-phase environments in electronic structure calculations.},

The Cooperative brings together laboratories with expertise and interest in theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of protein electrostatics. To improve structure-based energy calculations, it is necessary to better understand the physical character and molecular determinants of electrostatic effects. Thus, the Cooperative intends to foment experimental research into fundamental aspects of proteins that depend on electrostatic interactions. It will maintain a depository for experimental data useful for critical assessment of methods for structure-based electrostatics calculations. To help guide the development of computational methods, the Cooperative will organize blind prediction exercises. As a first step, computational laboratories were invited to reproduce an unpublished set of experimental pKa values of acidic and basic residues introduced in the interior of staphylococcal nuclease by site-directed mutagenesis. The pKa values of these groups are unique and challenging to simulate owing to the large magnitude of their shifts relative to normal pKa values in water. Many computational methods were tested in this first Blind Prediction Challenge and critical assessment exercise. A workshop was organized in the Telluride Science Research Center to objectively assess the performance of many computational methods tested on this one extensive data set. This volume of Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics introduces the pKa Cooperative, presents reports submitted by participants in the Blind Prediction Challenge, and highlights some of the problems in structure-based calculations identified during this exercise.

In four years, 17 complexes offered by crystallographers as targets prior to publication, have been subjected to structure prediction by docking their two components. Models of these complexes were submitted by predictor groups and assessed by comparing their geometry to the X-ray structure and by evaluating the quality of the prediction of the regions of interaction and of the pair wise residue contacts. Prediction was successful on 12 of the 17 targets, most of the failures being due to large conformation changes that the algorithms could not cope with. Progress in the prediction quality observed in four years indicates that the experiment is a powerful incentive to develop new procedures that allow for flexibility during docking and incorporate nonstructural information. We therefore call upon structural biologists who study protein\textendash{}protein complexes to provide targets for further rounds of CAPRI predictions.},

The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 CASP experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature of CASP targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.

  abstract = {Herein, we report the absolute binding free energy calculations of CBClip complexes in the SAMPL5 blind challenge. Initial conformations of CBClip complexes were obtained using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy calculations were performed using thermodynamic integration (TI) with soft-core potentials and Bennett's acceptance ratio (BAR) method based on a serial insertion scheme. We compared the results obtained with TI simulations with soft-core potentials and Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations with the serial insertion method combined with the BAR method. The results show that the difference between the two methods can be mainly attributed to the van der Waals free energies, suggesting that either the simulations used for TI or the simulations used for BAR, or both are not fully converged and the two sets of simulations may have sampled difference phase space regions. The penalty scores of force field parameters of the 10 guest molecules provided by CHARMM Generalized Force Field can be an indicator of the accuracy of binding free energy calculations. Among our submissions, the combination of docking and TI performed best, which yielded the root mean square deviation of 2.94 kcal/mol and an average unsigned error of 3.41 kcal/mol for the ten guest molecules. These values were best overall among all participants. However, our submissions had little correlation with experiments.},

Several DFT functionals partnered with correlation consistent basis sets were evaluated for the prediction of the partition coefficients. The approach chosen for the competition, a B3PW91 vertical solvation scheme, yields a mean absolute deviation of 1.9 logP units and performs well at estimating the correct hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity for the full SAMPL5 molecule set.},

We present a protocol for accurately predicting partition coefficients between two immiscible phases, and then apply it to 53 drug-like molecules in the SAMPL5 blind prediction challenge. Our results combine implicit solvent QM calculations with classical MD simulations using the non-Boltzmann Bennett free energy estimator. The OLYP/DZP/SMD method yields predictions that have a small deviation from experiment (RMSD = 2.3 loglog$\backslash$log D units), relative to other participants in the challenge. Our free energy corrections based on QM protomer and pKapKa\{$\backslash$text\{p\}\}K\_\{$\backslash$text\{a\}\} calculations increase the correlation between predicted and experimental distribution coefficients, for all methods used. Unfortunately, these corrections are overly hydrophilic, and fail to account for additional effects such as aggregation, water dragging and the presence of polar impurities in the apolar phase. We show that, although expensive, QM-NBB free energy calculations offer an accurate and robust method that is superior to standard MM and QM techniques alone.},

Two targets served as the framework to test community docking and scoring methods: (1) HSP90, donated by AbbVie and the Community Structure Activity Resource (CSAR), and (2) MAP4K4, donated by Genentech. The challenges for both target datasets were conducted in two stages, with the first stage testing pose predictions and the capacity to rank compounds by affinity with minimal structural data; and the second stage testing methods for ranking compounds with knowledge of at least a subset of the ligand\textendash{}protein poses. An additional sub-challenge provided small groups of chemically similar HSP90 compounds amenable to alchemical calculations of relative binding free energy. Unlike previous blinded Challenges, we did not provide cognate receptors or receptors prepared with hydrogens and likewise did not require a specified crystal structure to be used for pose or affinity prediction in Stage 1. Given the freedom to select from over 200 crystal structures of HSP90 in the PDB, participants employed workflows that tested not only core docking and scoring technologies, but also methods for addressing water-mediated ligand\textendash{}protein interactions, binding pocket flexibility, and the optimal selection of protein structures for use in docking calculations. Nearly 40 participating groups submitted over 350 prediction sets for Grand Challenge 2015. This overview describes the datasets and the organization of the challenge components, summarizes the results across all submitted predictions, and considers broad conclusions that may be drawn from this collaborative community endeavor.},

  abstract = {Binding selectivity is a requirement for the development of a safe drug, and it is a critical property for chemical probes used in preclinical target validation. Engineering selectivity adds considerable complexity to the rational design of new drugs, as it involves the optimization of multiple binding affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding selectivity is a challenge, and generally applicable methodologies are still not available to the computational and medicinal chemistry communities. Absolute binding free energy calculations based on alchemical pathways provide a rigorous framework for affinity predictions and could thus offer a general approach to the problem. We evaluated the performance of free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics for the prediction of selectivity by estimating the affinity profile of three bromodomain inhibitors across multiple bromodomain families, and by comparing the results to isothermal titration calorimetry data. Two case studies were considered. In the first one, the affinities of two similar ligands for seven bromodomains were calculated and returned excellent agreement with experiment (mean unsigned error of 0.81 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.75). In this test case, we also show how the preferred binding orientation of a ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free energy calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated and returned a more modest accuracy (mean unsigned error of 1.76 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation of 0.48); however, the reparametrization of a sulfonamide moiety improved the agreement with experiment.},

These approaches use a nonphysical pathway to compute free energy differences from a simulation or set of simulations and appear to be a particularly robust and general-purpose approach for this task. We also present an update (version 0.5) to our FreeSolv database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies of neutral compounds and provide input files in formats for several simulation packages. This revision to FreeSolv provides calculated values generated with a single protocol and software version rather than the heterogeneous protocols used in the prior version of the database. We also further update the database to provide calculated enthalpies and entropies of hydration and some experimental enthalpies and entropies as well as electrostatic and nonpolar components of solvation free energies.},

However, inferring mechanistically plausible protein signaling networks (PSNs) from phosphoproteomics data is a difficult task, owing in part to the lack of sufficiently comprehensive experimental measurements, the inherent limitations of network inference algorithms, and a lack of standards for assessing the accuracy of inferred PSNs. A case study in which 12 research groups inferred PSNs from a phosphoproteomics data set demonstrates an assessment of inferred PSNs on the basis of the accuracy of their predictions. The concurrent prediction of the same previously unreported signaling interactions by different participating teams suggests relevant validation experiments and establishes a framework for combining PSNs inferred by multiple research groups into a composite PSN. We conclude that crowdsourcing the construction of PSNs\textemdash{}that is, outsourcing the task to the interested community\textemdash{}may be an effective strategy for network inference.

The recent SAMPL4 challenge evaluated the AMOEBA polarizable force field in this regard but showed substantially worse results than those using the fixed-point-charge GAFF model. Starting with a set of automatically generated AMOEBA parameters for the SAMPL4 data set, we evaluate the cumulative effects of a series of incremental improvements in parametrization protocol, including both solute and solvent model changes. Ultimately, the optimized AMOEBA parameters give a set of results that are not statistically significantly different from those of GAFF in terms of signed and unsigned error metrics. This allows us to propose a number of guidelines for new molecule parameter derivation with AMOEBA, which we expect to have benefits for a range of biomolecular simulation applications such as protein\textendash{}ligand binding studies.},

Academic research, however, has barely investigated these prizes. This paper investigates the motivation of prize entrants, the characteristics of their research and development (R\&D) activities, and the overall effect of prizes on innovation using case study research and documentary data sources. The Ansari XPrize and the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge, both considered successful technology competitions in the aerospace sector, are investigated. The findings show that, first, incentives created by competitions, particularly those that are nonmonetary, attract unconventional entrants. The market value of the prize technologies motivate entrants as well but do not attract traditional industry players. Second, limited technology development lead times and no up-front funding characterize prize R\&D activities, yet their differences with traditional industry practices are caused by participant-level factors. Most importantly, the introduction of novel R\&D approaches is associated with the participation of unconventional entrants. Third, these prizes induced innovations over and above what would have occurred anyway, with the caveat that they were linked to significant technology incentives and fundamentally, ongoing R\&D processes. These findings put forward lessons that inform the design of more effective prize competitions.},

  abstract = {This paper applies the Bayesian Model Averaging statistical ensemble technique to estimate small molecule solvation free energies. There is a wide range of methods available for predicting solvation free energies, ranging from empirical statistical models to ab initio quantum mechanical approaches. Each of these methods is based on a set of conceptual assumptions that can affect predictive accuracy and transferability. Using an iterative statistical process, we have selected and combined solvation energy estimates using an ensemble of 17 diverse methods from the fourth Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) blind prediction study to form a single, aggregated solvation energy estimate. Methods that possess minimal or redundant information are pruned from the ensemble and the evaluation process repeats until aggregate predictive performance can no longer be improved. We show that this process results in a final aggregate estimate that outperforms all individual methods by reducing estimate errors by as much as 91\% to 1.2 kcal mol\textendash{}1 accuracy. This work provides a new approach for accurate solvation free energy prediction and lays the foundation for future work on aggregate models that can balance computational cost with prediction accuracy.},

  title = {Atomic Radius and Charge Parameter Uncertainty in Biomolecular Solvation Energy Calculations},
  abstract = {Atomic radii and charges are two major parameters used in implicit solvent electrostatics and energy calculations. The optimization problem for charges and radii is under-determined, leading to uncertainty in the values of these parameters and in the results of solvation energy calculations using these parameters. This paper presents a method for quantifying this uncertainty in solvation energies using surrogate models based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions. There are relatively few atom types used to specify radii parameters in implicit solvation calculations; therefore, surrogate models for these low-dimensional spaces could be constructed using least-squares fitting. However, there are many more types of atomic charges; therefore, construction of surrogate models for the charge parameter space required compressed sensing combined with an iterative rotation method to enhance problem sparsity. We present results for the uncertainty in small molecule solvation energies based on these approaches. Additionally, we explore the correlation between uncertainties due to radii and charges which motivates the need for future work in uncertainty quantification methods for high-dimensional parameter spaces. The method presented in this paper is a promising approach for efficiently quantifying uncertainty in a wide range of force field parameterization problems, including those beyond continuum solvation calculations.},

  abstract = {We review our performance in the SAMPL5 challenge for predicting host\textendash{}guest binding affinities using the movable type (MT) method. The challenge included three hosts, acyclic Cucurbit[2]uril and two octa-acids with and without methylation at the entrance to their binding cavities. Each host was associated with 6\textendash{}10 guest molecules. The MT method extrapolates local energy landscapes around particular molecular states and estimates the free energy by Monte Carlo integration over these landscapes. Two blind submissions pairing MT with variants of the KECSA potential function yielded mean unsigned errors of 1.26 and 1.53 kcal/mol for the non-methylated octa-acid, 2.83 and 3.06 kcal/mol for the methylated octa-acid, and 2.77 and 3.36 kcal/mol for Cucurbit[2]uril host. While our results are in reasonable agreement with experiment, we focused on particular cases in which our estimates gave incorrect results, particularly with regard to association between the octa-acids and an adamantane derivative. Working on the hypothesis that differential solvation effects play a role in effecting computed binding affinities for the parent octa-acid and the methylated octa-acid and that the ligands bind inside the pockets (rather than on the surface) we devised a new solvent accessible surface area term to better quantify solvation energy contributions in MT based studies. To further explore this issue a, molecular dynamics potential of mean force (PMF) study indicates that, as found by our docking calculations, the stable binding mode for this ligand is inside (rather than surface bound) the octa-acid cavity whether the entrance is methylated or not. The PMF studies also obtained the correct order for the methylation-induced change in binding affinities and associated the difference, to a large extent to differential solvation effects. Overall, the SAMPL5 challenge yielded in improvements our solvation modeling and also demonstrated the need for thorough validation of input data integrity prior to any computational analysis.},

Here we report new developments and progress from the CASP11 community experiment, assessing the state of the art in structure modeling. Notable points include the following: (1) New methods for predicting three dimensional contacts resulted in a few spectacular template free models in this CASP, whereas models based on sequence homology to proteins with experimental structure continue to be the most accurate. (2) Refinement of initial protein models, primarily using molecular dynamics related approaches, has now advanced to the point where the best methods can consistently (though slightly) improve nearly all models. (3) The use of relatively sparse NMR constraints dramatically improves the accuracy of models, and another type of sparse data, chemical crosslinking, introduced in this CASP, also shows promise for producing better models. (4) A new emphasis on modeling protein complexes, in collaboration with CAPRI, has produced interesting results, but also shows the need for more focus on this area. (5) Methods for estimating the accuracy of models have advanced to the point where they are of considerable practical use. (6) A first assessment demonstrates that models can sometimes successfully address biological questions that motivate experimental structure determination. (7) There is continuing progress in accuracy of modeling regions of structure not directly available by comparative modeling, while there is marginal or no progress in some other areas.

The assessment emphasis is placed on the accuracy in predicting long-range contacts. Twenty-nine groups participated in contact prediction in CASP11. At least eight of them used the recently developed evolutionary coupling techniques, with the top group (CONSIP2) reaching precision of 27\% on target proteins that could not be modeled by homology. This result indicates a breakthrough in the development of methods based on the correlated mutation approach. Successful prediction of contacts was shown to be practically helpful in modeling three-dimensional structures; in particular target T0806 was modeled exceedingly well with accuracy not yet seen for ab initio targets of this size ($>$250 residues).

Several iterations of design and characterization generated a 24-residue helix-turn-helix motif, including a 13-residue insertion, that increased enzyme activity $>$18-fold. X-ray crystallography showed that the large insertion adopts a helix-turn-helix structure positioned as in the Foldit model.

These challenges solicit submissions from the computational community to predict properties of interest, such as solvation, partition, or binding of drug-like molecules. These challenges provided substantial benefit to the community, and have led to roughly 100 publications, many of which are broadly cited (see attached bibliography). We are currently seeking funding from the NIH and surveyed the community concerning experiences with SAMPL and how our future plans for SAMPL can best align with the community's interests and needs. This document summarizes the results of this survey and describes our findings. On the whole, the community enthusiastically supports our plans for the future of SAMPL, and provided modest suggestions to further strengthen our plans. For up-to-date info please see the SAMPL website. Survey methods and results Here, we reproduce the results of the survey in full except for anonymizing respondents. Questions 1 and 2 dealt with identifying information (name and e-mail) and are thus bypassed here. There were 44 respondents, though not all respondents answered all questions. The survey was conducted via Google Forms from April 18 to June 19. The survey was advertised via Twitter and the Mobley Lab website, and e-mailed to to past participants.},

In this work, we present a GPU-based general alchemical free energy simulation platform for polarizable potential AMOEBA. Tinker-OpenMM, the OpenMM implementation of the AMOEBA simulation engine has been modified to enable both absolute and relative alchemical simulations on GPUs, which leads to a $\sim$200-fold improvement in simulation speed over a single CPU core. We show that free energy values calculated using this platform agree with the results of Tinker simulations for the hydration of organic compounds and binding of host\textendash{}guest systems within the statistical errors. In addition to absolute binding, we designed a relative alchemical approach for computing relative binding affinities of ligands to the same host, where a special path was applied to avoid numerical instability due to polarization between the different ligands that bind to the same site. This scheme is general and does not require ligands to have similar scaffolds. We show that relative hydration and binding free energy calculated using this approach match those computed from the absolute free energy approach. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
