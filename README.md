## Latex F32 Template by c-bun

Had a fun time getting this together for the April 2018 deadline. Thought that someone else might be able to use it. This template was inspired/forked/heavily edited from the one over at [https://github.com/choderalab/SAMPL-R01](). Thanks for the insipration Chodera/Mobley Lab!

**Please do not use any of my text. This is a real grant that I submitted.**

A few notes:
- The main magic is the ``F32.cls`` class file. That gets called at the top of all the other files and results in the nice tight formatting.
- Research and Specific Aims are bundled together so that they can produce a merged bibliography file, so you'll have to separate those three documents before submission.
- If you want to typeset everything, run ``typeset_all.sh``. If you have all the files there, it might take a while.

Have fun!!
