Long noncoding RNA lie at the center of many cellular processes, yet our ability to visualize this biomolecule as it moves throughout the cell is limited. Our group is developing a new imaging tool to track individual RNA molecules within living cells. This technique will enable visualization of molecules that have never been imaged before, yet are implicated in a wide variety of disease states.
