\bf EQUIPMENT
\end{center}

The Palmer lab has access to all of the equipment needed to perform the work proposed, most of which is present in the lab, the BioFrontiers Advanced Light Microscopy Core, and the Cell Culture Facility (both of which are across the hall from the lab).

\begin{itemize}
  \item Synthesis \begin{enumerate}
    \item 2 chemical fume hoods, 1 equipped with a vacuum line for airfree synthesis
    \item Mettler electronic analytical balances
    \item Rotary Evaporators
    \item LabAlliance high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvent delivery system equipped with a Rainin UV-1 detector (located in the lab of Zhongping Tan)
    \item Applied Biosystems Pioneer continuous flow peptide synthesizer (located in the lab of Zhongping Tan)
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Imaging \begin{enumerate}
    \item Nikon Ti-Eclipse Inverted Fluorescence Microscope with a iXon3 CCD camera (Andor) and a Dual view camera (DV2, Andor) for FRET imaging
    \item Nikon A1R Laser Scanning Confocal and TIRF Inverted Microscope with iXon X3 EMCCD
    \item Molecular Devices ImageXpress Micro XL System for high throughput-high content fluorescence microscopy
    \item Olympus IX-81 Inverted Microscope
    \item Nikon N-STORM and TIRF inverted microscopes for super-resolution microscopy with three cameras (2x Andor Ixon Ultra 897 EMCCD, 1x Hamamatsu ORCA Flash4.0 sCMOS)
    \item Nikon Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope
    \item An image analysis workstation with software: MatLab, Imaris, Nikon Elements, ImageJ/Fiji, ICY, and Cell Profiler
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Cell Culture \begin{enumerate}
    \item Biosafety cabinets for mammalian cell work
    \item BSL-2-certified biosafety cabinet for lentiviral work
    \item Centrifuge and ultracentrifuge
    \item CO\textsubscript{2} cell culture incubator
    \item Refrigerators and freezers (4, -20, and -80 $^\circ$C)
    \item Table top fluorescence microscope
    \item FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences)
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Molecular Cloning \begin{enumerate}
    \item Molecular biology-grade water system
    \item Cold room (4 $^\circ$C)
    \item Temperature-controlled incubating shakers
    \item Protein and DNA gel electrophoresis and Western blotting equipment
    \item heating blocks
    \item 37 $^\circ$C incubator
    \item PCR thermocyclers
